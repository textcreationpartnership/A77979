         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

He never to any Nation upon the earth ſent more faithful Ambaſſadours that have pleaded his cauſe with more power and evidence of the Spirit than to us in <hi>England,</hi> yet we have ſtood out.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, We have had as many offers of mercy as ever peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> had. Many a time we have been upon the brink of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and the bowels of God have been towards us and he hath ſaid, it ſhall not be.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, The Lord hath been as patient, he hath ſtaied as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> long as ever he did with any people before he came to execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Where do we reade of any people that have had a hundred yeers peace? (Ours is not much leſs;) Never that I know of in all the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, The Lord hath had us at advantages as much as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> can be; we have broke as many treaties as ever people broke. When we ſeemed to yeild unto God, we have but flattered him with our lips and dealt diſſemblingly with him.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, God hath broken the backs of others with whom <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> he hath had a controverſy. He hath had a controverſy with <hi>Germany,</hi> and how hath he dealt with them? Thus he begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to deal with us. It is reported that in <hi>Germany</hi> when the war was but twenty or thirty miles off them, they went on in their trading and followed their buſineſſes, buying and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and hoped that they ſhould be ſafe; ſo it is with us, Is not ſome part of <hi>England</hi> at this day as deſolate as <hi>Germany</hi> it ſelf?</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, Thoſe that knew moſt of Gods mind, have been <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/>
                     <pb n="10" facs="tcp:117708:18"/> ſo afraid of this controverſie that they have fled for fear of the wrath of God, and we have ſlighted, jeered them for it, thought it was their fooliſh timerouſneſs and melancholly conceit; The Lord now ſeems to juſtifie their fear.</p>
                  <p>The Lord is now for the preſent out againſt us in as dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a way of wrath as ever he was againſt any people of the earth. I never read in Scripture nor in Hiſtory of a more dreadful wrath of God againſt a people all things conſidered, than is againſt us at this day. <hi>Amos,</hi> 7.4. The Lord calls to contend by fire: Surely the Lord doth it at this day, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth to contend with <hi>England</hi> by fire, in a moſt dreadful way, and who knows what the end ſhall be? That he hath a moſt dreadful controverſy againſt <hi>England</hi> at this day, will appear if we further take theſe conſiderations.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, That a people complaining of bondage heretofore, yet when God offered deliverance, ſhould be ſo far left of God as they ſhall now rather be willing to make themſelves and their poſterity bond-ſlaves. Surely God hath a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful controverſy againſt us, it were elſe impoſſible that ſuch a thing ſhould be in the hearts of men. Men love liberty, they groan under bondage: We did groan but a few yeers ago, and the Lord was coming to help us, and yet we are now ſo left of God that we even turn again to our former bondage, and would have our ears to be bored that we might be perpetual ſlaves,</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, It is not only that we wil turn again to bondage, but this is out of a ſpirit of enmitie againſt the yoke of Jeſus Chriſt. This is the very ground and bottom of it, in a great part of the Kingdom, whatſoever yoke they have upon them they are reſolved they will not have the yoke of Chriſt out of a ſpirit of enmity againſt the Godly party, who deſire and endeavor Reformation.</p>
                  <p>At the beginning of this Parliament, when we began to have hopes of ſome liberty and reformation, Oh what a joy was there generally in the Kindom! all men agreed together; but when thoſe that were wicked and carnal began to ſee that their godly neighbours rejoyced &amp; that they bleſſed God for
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:117708:18"/> what was done that they had their minds; now they turn out of a ſpirit of malice againſt them, rather than they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce, rather than they ſhall have their minds, we will turn back again to the bondage we were in before, and we will ſtand and oppoſe that which heretofore we rejoyced in. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly here is the very ground of ſo much contradiction as there is at this day; They have therefore turned Malignants againſt that Cauſe which a man would wonder that ever ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional men ſhould be againſt; But there is a ſpirit of malice againſt Chriſt and his Ordinances, fearing a reformation; they would have their luſts, and they think if reformation come they ſhould not have them with that liberty they have had; here is the very reaſon that the Gentry and others in the country are oppoſite; Surely God hath a controverſie with us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That men ſhould ſo vily deſert thoſe whom they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> have choſen and truſted who have been faithful, thoſe Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies in Parliament, who have ventured their lives for them, baſely and unworthily now to deſert them; it is one of the greateſt judgments of God upon the hearts of men, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore upon a nation that ever was. If they complain of them now, they would much more have complained of them if they had complyed; ſuppoſe the Parliament had made up a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched reformation and a crazie peace that uppon any occaſion we had bin in danger to have had war broken out again, would not the people of the land have cried out of their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs? But now they venture themſelves and labour ſo hard for a ſound peace, therefore to be deſerted? An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy generation, a generation that we have cauſe to fear is become the generation of Gods wrath and the people of his curſe. People are affected according as ſucceſs is, we complain of thoſe in Parliament becauſe of ſome difficulties that are in the work, yet if they had not done what they did they would have complained much more. So of Miniſters, ſometimes Miniſters ſpeak and ſtir up people becauſe their conſciences tell them they ſhould be unfaithful to their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and to the cauſe of God if they did not; now they cry
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:117708:19"/> out as they did of <hi>Luther,</hi> that they are the trumpets of ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and rebellion; whereas on the other ſide if they ſhould ſay nothing, then people would have cryed out that they had betraied their Country and that they were not ſo faithful in their places as they ſhould, therefore people were ſo bad as they were. Thus hard it is for God or man to pleaſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>Again. That not only people ſhould deſert them, but that ſo many of Nobles, and ſome Members of the Parliament them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould deſert their Brethren there, and joyn with Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, French, and Walloons; When as not long ſince a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of vile wretches being gathered together to fight againſt our brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and yet thoſe vile people could not be brought to fight againſt them by any means; But now not the vile ones, but Nobles, Knights, and Gentry can be brought to fight againſt the Parliament their own Brethren; Is not here a mighty hand of God againſt us? Could this ever be if God had not a dreadful controverſie againſt <hi>England?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, That men ſhould be ſo blinded as to think the Proteſtant Religion ſhould be maintained by an Army of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, that the Laws and Liberty of the ſubject ſhould be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by an Army of Delinquents and ſtrangers, yea, that the King with Papiſts, Delinquents, French, and Walloons ſhould better maintain the Liberty of the Subject and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Religion, than with the Parliament; That people ſhould come to beleeve this, is not the hand of God upon the people of this land? Are they not infinitely beſotted? can we think that men indued with reaſon ſhould do this? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were not the Judgment of God fearfully upon their ſouls it could not be beleeved that ever this ſhould be done by people that had any rationality in them.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, God ſurely calls to contend fearfully with us in that he ſhould ſuffer ſuch an ill cauſe to proſper ſo as it hath done and to get to that height as it is. It is that which is the amazement both of <hi>England</hi> and the Countries about us that ſuch an ill cauſe ſhould get ſo high and proſper ſo much as it hath done; Surely the Lord is againſt us or elſe it could not have been.</p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:117708:19"/>
                  <p>Sixtly, When there ſhall be ſuch a deſperate deſign ſo long <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> a hatching, drawn forth in ſuch a ſeaſon and ſo driven on and now breaking forth in ſuch violence and yet men cannot ſee it. The tract of the deſign is a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> cleer as the Sun at noon day and drawn on from one ſtep to another, by comparing of one thing with another we may ſee it as apparantly as the light. Would you not think it a beſotting thing if there ſhould be a train of Gunpouder laied along in the ſtreets from ſuch a place to the Parliament Houſe to blow it up and yet that men ſhould paſs by and ſay they ſee no ſuch thing? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the drawing on of the deſign againſt our Religion and State, to bring us under tyranny and ſlavery, the tract is as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident and plain as ever there was train of Gunpruder laid to ſuch a place that men would willingly blow up; and yet men ſee it not. Surely Gods hand is out againſt us.</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, That we ſhould have ſo little fruit of our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> as we have at this day, yea, that God ſhould ſeem to be angry with the prayers of his people, This argueth a fearful controverſy, and in this one particular among others; what prayers in <hi>England</hi> have been ſent up to God for the Palſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graves children, and that now inſtead of anſwering our prayers God ſhould ſend two Arrows as it were out of thoſe loins to do us miſchief, that it ſhould come from them for whom <hi>England</hi> hath done ſo much to maintain them and ſent up ſo many prayers to God for them, and in recompence of all they ſhould come hither to make havoke of the Kingdom. Surely the hand of God is out againſt us.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, That our brethren ſhould be ſo ſpoil'd and our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> ſelves in ſuch danger of drinking the dregs of the cup, yet where are our hearts? The judgment of God is upon the hearts of men that they ſtir not and act not like men, but they ſee their Brethren ſpoild before them and in the mean time all that which keeps them quiet is only that they hope they ſhall be the laſt. Gods hand is upon the hearts of men this could not be elſe. Could one ever have thought that Engliſh men could have born this? If one had told them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that there ſhould be an Army of Papiſts riſe up with
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:117708:20"/> French, Walloons, and Iriſh to ſpoil the Kingdom, to deſtroy our Brethren, would one have ever imagined that Engliſh men ſhould have born it and ſtirred no more than they have done? You talk indeed of this and that and of going forth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very fourth man, but all ſuch reſolutions and ſuch great words of men do uſually ſink and fall down and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> if men were willing and content to lay down their necks upon the block. Surely the guilt of the blood of our Brethren may juſtly come upon us, and God may have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with us for ſuffering their blood to be ſpilt.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> Ninthly, That God ſhould put ſo many opportunities into our hands and we neglect all, thoſe opportunities of mercy: this is the hand of God againſt us and a fruit of his controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy with us.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> What ſhall I ſay more? That God himſelf ſhould take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our opportunities, that when we are nigh to deliverance that God ſhould drive us back, this is an argument of a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy controverſie indeed. <hi>Numb.</hi> 13. when the people were come very neer to Canaan and were even ready to take poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, God was reſolved againſt them, that none but <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> ſhould enter, they were beaten back again: now Chap. 14.33. it is ſaid that the people when they heard this, mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned greatly, they ſaw the hand of God out againſt them. The truth is we have been even in Canaan, Oh what an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity God put into our hands in the Weſt, I ſay not we loſt the opportunity, but there Gods own hand ſhewed it ſelf againſt us; <hi>Briſtol</hi> then might have been ſaved, but God would not; And ſo when we were even at our deliverance God ſeemed to drive us back, as if he told us, well I like not the buſineſs in hand, for this generation, I have ſomewhat more to ſay to them, it may be to their young ones I may ſhew mercy after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but againſt this generation my wrath ſhall be let out. Surely we may be afraid in regard of the waies of Gods pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent adminiſtration leſt this ſhould be in Gods heart. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever let us conſider it and mourn greatly before the Lord. <hi>God hath a controverſiy with the inhabitants of the land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is no time now to have controverſies one with another,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:117708:20"/> to be wrangling one with another, for this opinion and the other opinion. It is time for us now to lay down all our private controverſies and fall to the making up the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie with our God. It is no time now for Brethren to ſtrive with Brethren, but to ſtrive and wreſtle with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>od in prayer. If we have any ſtrength with us, let it not be ſpent in conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding one with another, but let all our ſtrength be ſpent in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king to make peace with our God. It is ſaid of the Romans that they had a Temple of Concord and none were to go to offer any further ſacrifice but thoſe that came firſt to offer in the Temple of Concord. The Lord looks it ſhould be ſo with us, we ſhould come and agr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:117708:21"/> and nature and the Laws of our land had made our own. We know the relation between him and us, and the bond it is mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual; and if there be any thing done now that perhaps can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be juſtified by any poſitive explicite Law of the land, let men know that yet it may be juſtified by the very light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and by the Law of Armes. It cannot be imagined but if thoſe that ought to be the protectors of the Law ſhould come againſt Law ſo hardly upon us, that we muſt have recourſe then to the Law and light of nature, it is impoſſible this ſhould be otherwiſe, and this God himſelf approves.</p>
                  <p>Whatſoever therefore becomes of this controverſy between him and us, whether reconciliation or not reconciliation, yet we have peace in this, that what we have done in the reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of a deluge of miſery that was coming upon us, if we had not done it, our conſciences would have upbraided us, the generation to come would have curſed us, the Nations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout us and our very enemies would have ſcorned us and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rided us for our baſe cowardlineſs, for our ſordid ſpirits, for an unworthy generation that ſhould ſee it ſelf and poſterity ſinking into miſery and brought under ſlavery, and out of baſe fear and ſluggiſh litherneſs of ſpirit and effeminate ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhould ſuffer all to be brought into bondage to the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and luſts of a few men. We can therefore with comfort and boldneſs ſtand at Gods Tribunal and plead the upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our hearts and juſtneſs of our cauſe in this Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie whatever becomes of it. But in the controverſie that God hath againſt us, there we fall down at his feet and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg our ſelves guilty before him, yea, we come with ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloath upon our loins and aſhes on our heads, with ropes on our necks, and plead only mercy for our lives. And this is the work that we have to do in all the daies of our humiliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſeek to make an Atonement between God and our ſouls and the Land in regard of that dreadful controverſie he hath againſt us. Now bleſſed God, becauſe thou telleſt us in thy word, <hi>Becauſe I WILL do this, therefore prepare to meet thy God O Iſrael:</hi> Thou threatneſt hard, great and ſore evils, and thou calleſt now to us, becauſe <hi>Thou wilt do this, England,</hi> O <hi>England</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:117708:21"/> prepare to meet God; We come (Oh that this might be our anſwer) we come Lord and meet thee with our ſouls bowed towards thee, with our hearts bleeding that we have provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee to cauſe ſo much bloodſhed of our brethren amongſt us. O Lord our hearts are open to thee, and with trembling ſpirits we cry to the Lord, what wilt thou have us do? If thou pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeſt againſt us in thy controverſie we are undone, we are undone, Oh Lord forgive, Oh Lord ariſe and be merciful we beſeech thee, <hi>for by whom ſhall</hi> Jacob <hi>riſe for he is ſmall?</hi> by whom ſhall the people ariſe? by whom ſhall the power of godlineſs and thine Ordinances be maintained?</p>
                  <p>How happy were we think ſome if the controverſie between the King and us were at an end, that we might have peace. Oh if the people were happy that were in ſuch a caſe, how happy the people that were at peace with the King of Heaven! If the controverſie between God and us were at an end we ſhould be happie indeed. The Lord and the Land is at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie, and this controverſie makes us cry out unto God; but yet wo unto us, here is the miſery, we yet keep our ſins that make the controverſie. <hi>Jer.</hi> 35. <hi>Will the Lord reſerve his anger for ever? will he keep it unto the end?</hi> Mark what the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer is, <hi>Behold thou haſt ſpoken and done evil things as thou couldeſt.</hi> Thus you have ſaid, but what is the fruit of this? <hi>You have done evil as you could.</hi> We in the daies of our Faſts cry, Lord wilt thou reſerve thine anger for ever? wilt thou keep it unto the end? Behold thus we ſpeak, but yet we continue to do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil as we can. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.9. <hi>We looked for light</hi> (ſaith the text) <hi>but behold obſcuritie, for brightneſs but we walk in darkneſs, we grope for the wall like the blind:</hi> We indeed grope as if we had no eyes and we ſtumble at noon day as if it were night.

In many places of the Kingdom they roar out as bears, and they have cauſe to do ſo, For they are miſerably ſpoiled, their wives raviſhed, their houſes plundered, themſelves impriſoned; and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:117708:22"/> for the reſt of us we mourn like doves night and day, and we look for judgment and there is none, and for ſalvation but it is far from us; Mark what follows, <hi>For our tranſgreſſions are multiplied before thee,</hi> (there is the ground of al the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie between God and us) <hi>and as for our ſins they teſtify againſt us, and our trangreſſions are with us.</hi> Surely my Brethren God is willing to be at peace with <hi>England</hi> again; the controverſy is great and ſore, yet we may confidently ſpeak that the Lord is yet willing to be at peace with <hi>England,</hi> and the ſufferings of <hi>England</hi> go as neer the heart of God as ours. Oh that we knew then what it is that is the great make-bate between God and us that we might get rid of it! Would you know it? 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.21. ſaith <hi>Joab</hi> there, <hi>Deliver us</hi> Sheba <hi>the ſon</hi> Bichri <hi>and we will depart from the Citie and go every one unto his tent.</hi> If amongſt us Delinquents were puniſhed as they ought, if the hearts of people were prepared to have the remainders of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and Idolatry caſt out, if they were willing to receive Jeſus Chriſt as King among them, the ſound of retreat would ſoon be heard, the controverſie would ſoon be at an end; and except this be the foundation of our peace, either there will be no peace at all, or it will not hold long. In our raiſing of forces therefore to help our ſelves and our brethren (ſeing we pretend we will do more than before, and it is time we ſhould if we be not a people deſtinated to deſtruction and ruine) be ſure we begin here, let us do more than ever we did before to make up this controverſie with God. It is reported of <hi>Achior</hi> one of <hi>Holopherneſs</hi> his Captains that he counſelled <hi>Holopher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> to enquire firſt whether the Jews had offended their God before he attempted to make war againſt them, for if they had, he then aſſured him that that would be their ruine and he might go up and overcome them, but if he could not hear that they had ſinned againſt their God it was in vain for him to ſtrive againſt them. Truly it concerns us neerly to make up our peace with God that when our adverſaries come out againſt us they may not indeed be made uſe of to avenge Gods quarrel upon us, for then they will eaſily improve all their advantages this way, and ſay indeed that they are not
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:117708:22"/> come out againſt us without the Lord; Every victory they now get they are ready to pleaſe themſelves in this and ſay that God fighteth againſt us, and God approveth them, they tell us the reaſon they prevail is becauſe God is againſt us, and ſo we know <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> did though a foul railer, yet ſaith he, Are we come up without the Lord? And the enemies of <hi>David Pſalm,</hi> 71.12. <hi>Mine enemies have ſaid, God hath forſaken him, now perſecute and take him, for there is none to deliver him:</hi> Thus they will be ready to ſay upon any occaſion, now the Lord hath left them, now let us take them: And certainly if the Lord ſhould ſuffer them to prevail many of them would think they do God good ſervice to ſlay and to root out that genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Gods people that is here in <hi>England,</hi> and they would be confident that it is the mind of God that they ſhould be rooted out. Therefore we had need look to it to make up our peace with God that the controverſie between him and us may not prove to be their victory.</p>
                  <q>The Lord hath a controverſy with the inhabitants of the Land.</q>
                  <p>There are only two notes to be further obſerved hence. God having to deal with poor earthen creatures, he might preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have let his wrath out againſt them and deſtroyed them: But Mark, God is willing to have his cauſe pleaded with vile creatures, ſo that all the while he is pleading there is time and ſpace for them to come in. This teacheth us this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent leſſon:<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> 
                     <hi>[That men ſhould be willing that the cauſe that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and their inferiours ſhould be pleaded, and not ſtand ſo much upon their ſuperiority, and ſcorn to humour an inferiour ſo much as to have any matter debated between them.]</hi> As husband and wife if a controverſie be between them, though the one be ſuperiour and the other inferiour, think it not much to debate it between themſelves with meekneſs and love, <hi>Job,</hi> 31.13. profeſt he did not deſpiſe the cauſe of his man-ſervent when he contended with him, but he would have that pleaded and made out. Jehovah, the mighty God condeſcendeth to put his cauſe to a ſuit, he will not paſs ſentence upon poor crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures til it come to a tryal. Be not ſurly and ſcornful towards your inferiours.</p>

                  <p>Another Note, <hi>[The inhabitants of the Land]</hi> lies a little more couched. The inhabitants of the Land, what Land? The inhabitants of the Land of Canaan, a controverſie with them. Mark, God fulfilled his promiſe in bringing them into the Land of Canaan, and now he pleadeth with them for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of their promiſe. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 105.44, 45. he tells them that he had given them the lands of the Heathen, that they might obſerve his Statutes and keep his Laws, that was their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

You know God often gave them charge when they came into the land to do this and this, they promiſed they would do it, but when they were once brought into the land they forgot it, they forſook God. God now comes and pleads with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this land; As if he ſhould ſay, I have done my part in bringing you into the land, now I come to plead with you for breaking your promiſe and covenant. Take this note from hence. <hi>[Whatſoever mercy you have from God you are to look upon it as a fruit of Gods faithfulneſs to you (if you be Gods) and as a ground of your obedience to him,</hi>

                     <hi>The inhabitants of the Land.] Hierome</hi> hath another note upon it, but that is further off, I will only name it. Rightly ſaith he are they called to anſwer and to judgment that are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the land, and do not look upon themſelves as ſojourners and ſtrangers in the land; But he that can truly ſay with the Prophet, <hi>I am a pilgrim &amp; a ſtranger here,</hi> ſuch a one can never do that which may cauſe God to have a controverſy againſt him. This is the reaſon men do that which cauſeth God to have a controverſie with them, becauſe they look upon themſelves as poſſeſſors of the land, and not as pilgrims and ſtrangers. But this is too far off.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond part followeth. <hi>[God declareth.]</hi> A ſute firſt is entred againſt ſuch a man, when the Court day comes, there is calling for a declaration, the Lawyer declares: God doth ſo, and the Prophet is Gods Lawyer, and here are three Articles put in thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:117708:23"/>
                  <p>Firſt in general, that there is a declaration, take theſe two uſeful notes from thence.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>God contendeth not with a people without a cauſe.</hi> How many are there that ſtrive and contend one with another without any cauſe at all! they vex and rage, contend and ſue and great controverſies there are, but if we come to examin the cauſe we can find nothing at all; great dull is raiſed but whence is it? if we look to the bottom and examin where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, we can ſee juſt nothing, they themſelves know no cauſe, they can give no rational account of all their pleading, one againſt another. As <hi>David</hi> ſaid to <hi>Eliah</hi> his eldeſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.29. when <hi>Eliah</hi> came and wrangled with him, ſaith <hi>David, What have I now done? is there not a cauſe? Eliahs</hi> ſpirit was up through his envy, chiding and wrangling with <hi>David;</hi> but what have I done ſaith <hi>David,</hi> have not I cauſe for what I did! Thus many have their ſpirits up, chiding and wrangling, but examin the cauſe, and they can ſhow none at all. How many are there of bitter ſpirits, who even go about like mad-dogs, ſnarling at every one, even at thoſe they know not, with whom they had never any thing to do, yet cry out againſt them, railing upon them every where! Ask them, do you know the man? can you prove any hurt againſt him? The truth is they know him not, they are not able to make good what they ſay, only there is a general noiſe of ſuch and ſuch men that they do thus and thus, and ſo they bite and ſnail, and rage againſt them, but when all comes to all they know no cauſe. Such and ſuch men they ſay diſturb the Kingdom and trouble the people, a grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

You would think when you hear ſuch railings and cryings out againſt ſuch and ſuch men, that they were the moſt monſtrous men upon the earth, but examin what it is that they have done, there is nothing. God doth not ſo with you, God never contendeth with man but for a juſt cauſe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Becauſe there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledg of God in the land,</hi> but by ſwearing, and lying, and ſtealing &amp;c.

Not that little things do not deſerve a controverſie, but it is from the vertue and fruit of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that this comes to paſſe; in others that are not in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant little things make a controverſie, but between Gods children and himſelf they are not little things that make a controverſie. But men are of froward ſpirits, every trifle is enough to make a controverſie between them. Yea, uſually th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> greateſt controverſies between neereſt friends is ſome trifle or other. Is there a man and his wife live lovingly and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly many yeers, do they fall out afterwards? Is there a bitter controverſie? Examin it, it is but about ſome toy. So be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one brother and another. I could give you examples in Hiſtories of great and bitter controverſies that have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween neereſt friends upon ſmall and trivial grounds. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Camerarius</hi> tells us a ſtory of two brethren, theſe two walking out in a ſtar-light night, ſaith one of the brethren would I had a paſture as large as this Element, and ſaies the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would I had as many Oxen as there be Stars; ſaies the other again, where would you feed theſe Oxen? in your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, replied he; what whether I will or no? Yea ſaid he whether you will or no; what in ſpight of me? yes ſaid he; and thus it went on from word to word till at length each ſheath'd his ſword in the others bowels. This verifieth that ſaying of <hi>James,</hi> Chap. 3.5. <hi>Behold how great a matter a little fire kindleth!</hi> So it is in many families, ſometimes perhaps a look is the beginning of a great controverſie, one thinks ſuch a one doth not look lovingly upon him, and then he begins to ſuſpect that things boil within him, perhaps afterward ſome words come forth that may ſeem to argue diſcontent, and then that word begetteth another, and that other a third, and ſo a miſerable breach cometh to be in a family. It is an argument that theſe people have Gunpouder ſpirits that a little ſpark of fire can ſo quickly blow them up. Truly the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:117708:24"/> controverſie here in <hi>England</hi> the ground of it at the firſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was little enough on our parts; Only were it not that there had bin a deſperate deſign in our adverſaries, it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that ſuch a little beginning ſhould ever come to that height. But God doth not ſo, they are great things for which he hath a controverſie with the inhabitants of the land.</p>
                  <p>But what is it? what is the declaration? <hi>No truth, nor mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, nor knowledg of God in the land.</hi> Theſe three eſpecially, the firſt doth exceeding neerly concern us.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>No Truth.</hi> God is a God of Truth, he is true in all his waies. He juſtly pleads with them that have dealt falſly with him. No truth; No reality in their Religion, that is ſomething, but that is not all. God comes upon them for the breaches firſt of the ſecond Table; for they ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

If you ſpeak to them concerning ſins in matters of Religion, they will ſay they acknowledg the true God and they wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him. Well, therefore the Prophet begins firſt herein the matters of the ſecond Table, concerning the want of truth between man and man; As if he ſhould ſay, Talk what your will concerning your worſhiping of the true God, there is no truth between one another, you deal falſly and cruelly, and are mercileſs to your brethren, never therefore talk of Religion and of acknowledging the true God.<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> Thence the Note is this. <hi>[That it is in vain for any man to talk of his Religion, if he make no conſcience of the ſecond Table as well as the firſt.]</hi> For a man to talk of praying, and hearing Sermons, if he be cruel and hard hearted, and falſe in his dealings, the Lord rejecteth all let him talk what he will.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>No truth in your dealings one with another.</hi> Firſt there is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of flattery amongſt you. You flatter one another in your ſin, you do not deal unfainedly one with another. You flatter your Princes, and your Princes have little truth in their Courts. It was once a ſpeech of one, <hi>All things were plentiful in the Court but only truth.</hi> And this is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of great men that thoſe that are about them uſually deal
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:117708:25"/> falſly with them. You ſhall ſeldom know one that deals truly with great men, they tell them that their bloodſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and ruining of Kingdoms is but the maintaining of their juſt Honor and Prerogative. I have read of <hi>Dioniſius</hi> his flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, that when he ſpit upon the ground they would lick it up and then tell him that that ſpittle was ſweeter than any <hi>Ambroſia</hi> and <hi>Nectar,</hi> the ſweeteſt that ever they taſted, meerly to pleaſe him: And ſo you have many that are neer to great men, though they ſee them do things never ſo abominable; things that make never ſo great breaches between God and them, between them and people, yet they tell them that they do more bravely than ever any of their Anceſtors did. <hi>There is no truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Truth here ſome take for Juſtice. Thus it is ſometimes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in Scri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nor <hi>No Mercy:</hi> That is, you ſhew no mercy to the innocent; you talk of indulgence, your indulgence to Delinquents is cruelty to innocents, Oh how many of our brethren in <hi>Oxford</hi> and other places ſuffer moſt dreadful things becauſe theſe here enjoy ſo much liberty and have ſo much favour as they have. So there is neither mercy to the <hi>Innocent</hi> not juſtice to the <hi>Nocent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the ſpecial thing here intended is, <hi>That you are not true in your dealings nor in the truſt committed to your charge;</hi> There is no equitie in your dealings. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 59.14. <hi>And judgment is turned backward,</hi> (it is turned upon thoſe that it ſhould not be exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted upon) <hi>And juſtice ſtandeth a far off.</hi> If one be greater than another, the meaneſt ſhall come under the ſtroke of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and be executed, and the greater not: <hi>And truth is fallen in the ſtreets;</hi> how comes that in? Thus, as if he ſhould ſay, It is true, they that are in place of Authority will not execute
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:117708:25"/> judgment and juſtice, but are not the common people faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in their dealings one with another, No, <hi>Truth is faln in the ſtreets:</hi> this ſeems to refer to the multitude; <hi>And equity cannot enter;</hi> the word that is here tranſlated <hi>Equity,</hi> comes of a word that ſignifies a thing that is juſt before one; As if he ſhould ſay, thoſe very things that one would think were as plain (as we ſay) as the noſe on a mans face, things that are ſo evident, that are juſt before us, that have ſo much equitie and reaſon in them, yet thoſe things cannot enter, thoſe things cannot be entertained, there is ſuch a general confuſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the people, ſuch a corruption among them, they are ſo ſet upon wickedneſs, that things that are equal and plain according to common ſenſe and reaſon, yet it cannot enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts, they will not receive it. And is not this in a great meaſure our condition at this time?</p>
                  <p>There is no Truth, they are falſe in the truſt committed to their charge. Oh here is a controverſie indeed that God may have againſt us. Was there ever a time that either <hi>England</hi> or any other country knew when there was ſo much falſneſs in men in the truſt committed to them? All things in <hi>Iſrael</hi> at this time were come to that confuſion, that through the falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of men any thing of the greateſt conſequence that might be was betrayed. It is a ſign of Gods fearful wrath upon our Nation that there is no truth in men, when people are leſt to the treachery and perfidiouſneſs of others; that ſuch whom one would think one might be confident of their truth, nay venture their lives upon it, yea, ſuch as a long time before were truſtie; yea, truſtie to admiration, yet at laſt when they think they may ſuffer, [their own ends are not ſo clear to attain to as at firſt] they will betray all that truſt that is committed to them and venture even their own undoing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than endure further hazard in that way of truſt. Such curſed ſelviſhneſs is there in the hearts of men that have not the grace and true fear of God to ballance their hearts; they will even betray God himſelf and a whol Kingdom for their own private ends. But what an unworthy thing is this for men to betray publick truſt when ſo much miſchief may come
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:117708:26"/> upon it meerly for their own ends; It is as if a man ſhould ſet an houſe on fire to roaſt an egg: what are mens own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ends in compariſon of a Kingdom? not ſo much as an egg in compariſon of an houſe. This was the complaint in <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah's</hi> time of <hi>Judah</hi> as well as of <hi>Iſrael</hi> here, <hi>Micah</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with <hi>Hoſea, Mic.</hi> 7.5. <hi>Truſt not in a friend, put ye no confidence in a guide, keep the doors of thy mouth from her that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in thy b ſom: A mans enemies</hi> (ver. 6.) <hi>are the men of his own houſe.</hi> But though there are many of them thus corrupt and there is no truth in them, you cannot tell how to put any truſt in them, are there not ſome of them better?

                     <hi>Gods controverſie with Covenant-breakers, with thoſe that betray their truſt, is very dreadful.</hi> I will ſhew you an example or two out of the Scripture and out of Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>Firſt that notable place in 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21. when there was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min in the daies of <hi>David</hi> three yeers together, <hi>David</hi> would know what the matter was, God gave him this anſwer, <hi>That twas for</hi> Saul <hi>and his bloody houſe, becauſe he ſlew the Gibeonites;</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:117708:26"/> Becauſe <hi>Saul</hi> would not keep that truſt to the Gibeonites that was promiſed them, God therefore brings a famin upon the whol Land for three yeers together: And I beſeech you mark the aggravation here of Gods diſpleaſure againſt any that break truſt; firſt this promiſe was not made by <hi>Saul,</hi> but by <hi>Sauls</hi> Progenitors, and it was made above three hundred yeers before his time, And then to whom was it made? unto a Heatheniſh people, to the Gibionites; And this promiſe they got deceitfully, they deceived <hi>Joſhua</hi> and ſo got it by craft; further it was a promiſe made them without asking counſel of God, ſo the text ſaith, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 9.14. Again, this promiſe was againſt the mind of the congregation, verſe 18. <hi>All the congregation murmured againſt the Princes:</hi> Again, <hi>Saul</hi> when he ſlew the Gibeonites he did not do it out of a perfidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirit, but out of a good intent, for ſo the text ſaith, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.2. <hi>He ſlew them in his zeal to the children of Iſrael,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thought that the Gibeonites remaining amongſt them would perhaps prove ſome hinderance to the good of Iſrael. Further, this work of God comes not upon <hi>Saul</hi> then when he broke the truſt, but upon his poſterity afterward, and that ſhews it to be greater wrath. Laſtly it comes ſo upon them as it will not be appeaſed till it hath their lives: you may ſee then how God is ſet upon it to revenge promiſe-breakers.</p>
                  <p>Another example as notable as that, is in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17 15. when <hi>Zedekiah</hi> the King of <hi>Judah</hi> had made a Covenant with the King of Babylon, and broke it, he rebelled againſt him in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his Ambaſſadours into Egypt that they might give him horſes and much people; <hi>Shall he proſper ſaith the Lord? ſhall he eſcape that doth ſuch things, or ſhall he break the covenant and be delivered?</hi> This covenant was made with a wicked man with a Tyrant, and yet God calls it his Oath and his Covenant, ver. 18. And then with what an Emphaſis doth God ſpeak this. <hi>He deſpiſed the Oath by breaking the Covenant when lo he had given his hand</hi> yea ver. 16.

                        </gap>ompenſe upon his own head:</hi> Then further, God tels him that all the ſtrength that he had got to him and all his policie and all his cunning devices ſhould not help him, ver. 20. <hi>I will ſpread my net upon him and he ſhall be taken in my ſnare, and I will bring him unto Babylon and will plead with him there for his treſpaſs that he hath treſpaſſed againſt me:</hi> And laſtly, the wrath of God ſhall not only be upon him, but upon all thoſe that joyned with him and a bet him in the breaking of this covenant, ver. 21. <hi>All his fugitives with all his hands ſhall fall by the ſword, and they that remain ſhall be ſcattered towards all winds.</hi> I know not two ſcriptures more full for Gods being ſet to contend with men for breach of promiſe. Oh take heed all you that are intruſted in any publick truſt that you break not covenant.</p>
                  <p>And as you have examples of this in the Scripture, ſo there is alſo an example or two in Hiſtory which are exceeding full for this purpoſe. I ſuppoſe that is known unto you of <hi>Rodolphus,</hi> who having ſet his hand to a Covenant with <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the fourth</hi> which he afterward brake, and his right hand co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to be cut off, his conſcience accuſed him, Oh ſaith he, <hi>This is that right hand that ſubſcribed the Covenant, and now God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeth the breach of it upon this right hand.</hi> But above all that is the moſt remarkable that is in the Hiſtory of the <hi>Hungarians,</hi> concerning <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>diſlaus</hi> the King of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and <hi>Amurath</hi> the great Turk; they report that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>diſlaus</hi> making war with <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murath,</hi> having before promiſed the contrary; in a battle between them the Turk had the worſt of it, AMURATH being there and having with him the Covenant made between the King of <hi>Hungary</hi> and him, and ſeeing himſelf put to the worſt, he plucked forth the Covenant out of his boſom and with his eyes fixed toward Heaven he ſpeaks thus, <hi>This Oh Jeſus Chriſt is the Covenant that thy Chriſtians have ſtruck with me, O holy Jeſus they have done it in thy Name and ſworn by thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtie, and yet they have violated it, they have perfidiouſly denied their God; Now Oh Jeſus if thou beeſt a God as they ſay and as we gueſs thou art, revenge this wrong that is done unto me and unto thy
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:117708:27"/> ſelf upon theſe that have violated their faith and promiſe, and do thou ſhew unto us that do not know thy Name that thou art an avenger of ſuch as betray their truſt, and then we ſhall know thee to be a God.</hi> Now juſt upon this God ſo ordered it that the <hi>Hungarians</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the better of the day, they through covetouſneſs of the prey broke off the fight &amp; fel upon the loaden Camels, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Turks totally routed the Hungarians, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>diſlaus</hi> their King was ſlain, and a famous Victory left unto <hi>Amurath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee how God will be avenged for the breach of truſt, certainly God will follow thoſe that have been guilty of it; we ſee it apparantly how God follows them already. And indeed if we have to deal with men that are popiſh<note n="*" place="margin">As <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolphus</hi> &amp; <hi>Vdiſlaus</hi> were.</note> how is it poſſible that we can confide in them in any thing they promiſe, in any thing they agree to? For we know it is their very opinion, that <hi>fides non ſervenda hereticis,</hi> faith is not to be kept with hereticks; This Is their opinion they hold, that for the <hi>Catholick Cauſe</hi> they may break al their truſt, promiſes and covenants. Certainly that people are beſotted that ſhal ſo depend upon thoſe that are Papiſts and carried away by Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, as to lay their lives, their liberties, and their outward comforts at their feet, at their mercy; for certainly there is no truth in them. The Nations of the earth are even beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this, that they will ever make any covenant, any league with Papiſts who hold ſuch an opinion that they may break all their Covenants for the Catholick cauſe. What a caſe ſhould we be in if we lie down at the mercy of thoſe that have no truth in them, when afterwards we ſhall find they break aſſunder al their bonds of agreement and all their covenants, &amp; then we our ſelves know that this was their opinion before, and that they would enter into league and make peace with us meerly to ſerve their own turns, and when they have what they would have then to make our eſtates, lives, and liberties to be a prey to them? But we muſt let that paſſe, only this in a word added to it.</p>

You who are undone for ever it you had not mercy ſupplied every hour, and yet You unmerciful to your brethren? This plea wil ſtop the mouths of all Unmerciful ones.

This was that wicked <hi>Herod,</hi> and yet in time of publick calamity thus merciful was he to the poor. Surely God muſt needs have a controverſie with Iſrael then, with Chriſtians then that have received ſo much mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from the Lord if they ſhall be unmerciful in times of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon calamity. And if ever unmercifulneſs were a vile ſin and provoked God againſt a people, it muſt needs do now at ſuch a time as this, when there are ſo many objects of pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration daily preſented before us: If this ſhould but prove to be our charg, that there is no mercy in the land at this day, God muſt needs have a fearful controverſie againſt us. The
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:117708:28"/> whole land cannot be ſaid to be charged now as at ſome time it might have been. Not long ſince in <hi>England</hi> there hath been crying out of violence and wrong, thoſe which ruled o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver us have ruled over us with violence, rigour, and cruelty, according to that complaint <hi>Ezek.</hi> 34.4. <hi>With cruelty and force have ye ruled my people. They have turned judgment to wormwood, Amos,</hi> 5.7. Their Courts of Juducature that ſhould have been for right judgment have been turned into bitter wormwood and have been full of cruelty.

The Lord doth at this day charge this upon ſome of them, and will charge it more. I remember once a ſpeech of a reverend Divine in this, Citie, now with God, whom you all honored when he was alive, being put into that Court, the high Commiſſion, when he came home one day from thence he tells this ſtory of what he obſerved there.

We have amongſt us thoſe who as <hi>Pſal</hi> 27.12. breath our cruelty, and indeed they act nothing leſs, there is cruel hatred in their hearts and waies, according to that Pſalm, 25.19. No marvel therefore though heretofore our brethren left the Kingdome, becauſe they found ſuch cruelty here there was no mercy in the land; they did but according to that which the Church calleth the members of it to, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Come with me from Labanon from the Lyons dens, from the mountains of the Leobards.</hi> When they went from us, they went from the Lyons dens, and from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains

Cruel men know not God. Theſe two are put together and joyned moſt elegantly in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.20. <hi>The dark places of the earth are ful of the habitations of crueltie</hi> (ſaies the text.) The knowledg of God will make men civil and humane at leaſt, but when there is no knowledg of God men grow cruel and ſavage. And do we not find this to be true at this very day? From what places are men that do now riſe up to be plunderers, to ſhed blood, to be cruel in moſt deſperate outrages, from what places are theſe men beholden for their aſſiſtors and abettors this way? Are they not behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to places where they are in ignorance, where they have no knowledg of God, where there is no preaching? In the Countries round about obſerve thoſe Pariſhes, thoſe Towns, where there hath been leaſt or worſt preaching, where they have had leaſt knowledg of God, there you have moſt malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, that are bloody and cruel. No mervail then that our adverſaries are ſuch enemies to the faithful preachers of the word of God; no marvel then they are made the But of their malice; for indeed if they bring the knowledg of God into the land they will bring humanitie, civilitie, they will bring mercy and love, and there wil be few or none that will be fit for their turns. Indeed it is their complaint of the Parliament that they ſet ignorant men in places, but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this complaint is but a pretence, for it were better for their turns that all the congregations in <hi>England</hi> had but ignorant men, had no men to bring the knowledg of God amongſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but they know well enough what ever they ſay, that

Surely they refuſed to know the Lord, they ſhut their eyes againſt the knowledg of God, they ſay to God, depart from us we deſire not the knowledg of thy waies.

How many men of excellent parts in reſpect of all outward affairs, in the country and Citie, come and ſpeak to them about mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of State, they will ſpeak underſtandingly about them, they have deep reaches for State affairs; ſpeak to them about the affairs of Merchandize, of their trades, they will ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandingly; but ſpeak to them about God, about Chriſt, about the things of eternal life, how poorly, how weakly, how childiſhly, how ſottiſhly ſhall you have them ſpeak about thoſe things!

                  <p>But though they had ſome means of knowledg, yet their means did grow very ſhort. And there are two ſpecial reaſons why Iſrael at this time was without knowledg, why there was no knowledg of God in the land of Iſrael.</p>

As ſome not contented with ordinary plain letters they make ſuch flouriſhes about them that you can ſcarce tell what they are; you ſhall have ſome write their names with ſuch flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes that you can not tell what to make of them; ſo many men that will not content themſelves with plain Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with the Ordinances of Chriſt, but they muſt have flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes of their own inventions, at length you know not what to make of them, they come to darken the right underſtanding of the mind and truths of God. <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>if they ſpeak not according to theſe it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is no light in them.</hi> If they will leave the Law and the Teſtimony and will go according to their own inventions in Divine Worſhip, it is becauſe there is no light in them, they are in darkneſs, and they will bring darkneſs upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.22. it is ſaid of the rudiments of the world and the Ordinances of men, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Our adverſaries call Images and Pictures lay mens books to teach them; but the Scripture tels us they teach a lye; And if they be lay mens books, there are many Erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taes in them, they are full af Errataes in every Page and more Errataes than true lines. The beſt that we can ſay of any Ceremonies brought into the Church by men, (becauſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would ſtrive and ſtudy to excuſe the firſt Reformers) that they thought at that time there was ſome uſe of them in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:117708:32"/> the Common Prayer Book, that it was to ſtir up the dull minds of men. But mark, if it could poſſibly be imagined that there could be any uſe of them at the firſt, in the firſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation (which indeed there was not, but rather they did hurt and made mens minds more dull, as I dare appeal to you, thoſe that have lived continually under ſuch inventions of men in Gods worſhip.) But if poſſibly (I ſay) there could be imagined any uſe of them at the firſt, the beſt is that they were but as Horn book, and fiſtcue<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> for the childhood and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy of the Church. They ſay themſelves that they needed ſuch things, but to put the beſt gloſſe on them, they needed them but as children need Horn books and fiſtcues. And is it ſeemly alwaies to learn upon them? what knowledg ſhall be got if when you ſet your children to learn to reade they ſhall be kept ten, twenty, or thirty years to their Horn books? Now thus would our Prelates have debaſed people to keep them continually to learn the knowledge of God by their Horn-books and fiſtcues.</p>
                  <p>Now take theſe two reaſons together, Unteaching Prieſts, and Mans Inventions, they keep out the knowledge of God from a people; And they are brought on purpoſe to bring blindneſs, becauſe that is moſt fit and ſutable to the deſign that men have to bring people under ſlavery. So it was here, <hi>Jeroboam</hi> at that time when <hi>Hoſea</hi> propheſied, his deſign was to bring the people under ſlavery, to keep them from the houſe of <hi>David</hi> to be his ſlaves, and what courſe doth he take? He firſt ſets up the baſeſt and loweſt of the people to be their Prieſts: and ſecondly he introduceth falſe worſhip, and that brings in blindneſs and ignorance, and ſo by this means he knew he ſhould ſoon bring them under ſlavery. And nothing is more cleer than this, that it hath been the deſign of many that would have been Rulers of the Church, they have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored with al their might, (as ſervicable unto others) to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:117708:32"/> unto Sermons? it was even matter enough to ſilence any Miniſter to have people flocking to hear him preach; ſo they were enraged at peoples repeating of Sermons in their private families, becauſe it was a way to bring in knowledge. Any thing that was a way to bring in knowledg, their hearts were enraged againſt it, why? Becauſe they knew knowledg would keep men that they would never bear ſlavery; And truly it is a very ſtrange thing, that though in ſome Countries (as in <hi>Wales</hi> and in other places) where men have not knowledge they are contented to come under ſlavery; but that in theſe parts where there is, though not ſo much as ſhould be, yet ſuch a degree of the knowledg of God as there is, one would think it impoſſible that men ſhould ſuffer themſelves to be brought into ſlavery here; and that they fear moſt. We reade of the Philiſtims that when they had taken <hi>Sampſon,</hi> they put out his eyes, and then they made him to grind in the Mill. So theſe men would fain make us to grind in the Mill, (as it is ſaid ſome have threatned to make the Dames of <hi>London</hi> to work for a peny a day in <hi>Bridewel</hi>) They would fain make you al ſlaves, but firſt they would put out your eyes, they would take away knowledge and then they know they ſhall ſoon make you ſlaves. Well, the Lord hath promiſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.7 <hi>That he wil deſtroy the face of the covering caſt over all people, and the vail that is ſpread over all Nations;</hi> And mark: <hi>In that day</hi> (ver. 9.) <hi>it ſhall be ſaid, Lo, this is our God, we have waited f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The greateſt man upon earth hath no liberty from God, no prerogative to ſave a Murde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, but he that ſheds blood by man muſt his blood be ſhed.

(I mean innocents in this regard, in regard of the cauſe for which they were murdered:) We now in <hi>England</hi> begin to be ſomewhat ſenſible of the guilt of Murder what it is to have it lie upon a Nation.

Take this ſpeech barely conſidered and it is a good ſpeech, and we are all I hope of the ſame mind, Curſed be that man I ſay that ſhall not yeild to this. But certainly peace though upon hard terms, it were to be deſired, if that peace would ſave blood; though half our eſtates went for it; But what if it prove that that peace we talk of ſhould be a means of more bloodſhed? If you ſhould let in ſuch men into your City as bloody <hi>Papiſts, French, Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loons,</hi> and <hi>Iriſh Rebels,</hi> and that meerly upon their bare word that they would do you no hurt, do not you think if they were once in, that you would every night be in danger of maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacring? and would there not be much more bloodſhed than yet hath been? Therefore let not men ſay that thoſe are bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy men that will not yeild up their throats to bloody men, that will ſtand up to defend their brethren from being maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred; but they ſtand up and take up Arms, not to ſhed blood but to prevent the ſhedding of blood: For certainly if the Citie and Country had in the beginning of theſe wars roſe up as one man and gone into the field, they might have ſaved a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of blood that hath been ſhed. Many thouſands that have now loſt their lives might have been preſerved if you had took up Arms to more purpoſe ſooner than you did: But when every County looks to it ſelf, and the enemy goes to ſuch a County and there ſheds blood, and then to another and there ſheds blood, and you ſit ſtill and do nothing, God may require the blood of your brethren at your hands; and you cannot clear your ſelves from being guilty of the ſheding of the blood of your Brethren when you do not appear to the uttermoſt you are able to ſubdue the power of thoſe that ſhed their blood.

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:117708:39"/> of your blood to lay your necks upon the block, for that which commeth under ſuch a ſpecious name, may be in truth no other but a laying your necks upon the block, and giving up your wives and children to be a ſacrifice to their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Lord hath a controverſie for Blood.</hi> We know when we have to deal with Papiſts what they have been of old, and therefore we hope God hath a controverſie with that partie, that as they have drunk the blood of the Saints, ſo they ſhall at laſt ſwell and burſt themſelves in pieces. In <hi>France</hi> they had as good terms of Agreement as we can expect in the time of that Maſſacre, and yet Hiſtories tel us of more than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Proteſtants that were murdered in one night in <hi>Paris,</hi> and that at that time when they were in as fair a way of peace as poſſibly could be, and there was a Marriage ſolemnized and a great deal of rejoycing for the Union of one partie with another, and yet (I ſay) in that night ſo many were ſlaine; and you may expect no other if the Malignant partie get po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. You will ſay, They have not done ſo to other Cities which they have taken. No, they have not got the day yet, they are but in their deſign yet if once they get this Citie, then they have got the day, and having gotten the day, you may expect all manner of cruelty from them. And this Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre in <hi>France</hi> went on to other Cities, for within a few daies after there were fourty thouſand more computed to be mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. I remember that Hiſtorie of <hi>France</hi> tels us of that King <hi>Charls</hi> the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> by whoſe Commiſſion this was done, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward God ſtruck him with ſuch a diſeaſe, as that there iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out of his body at ſeveral places nothing but blood, ſo that in that ſickneſs he would ſometimes fall down and wal-himſelf in his own blood, Be men great or ſmall, yet being guilty of blood, at one time or other the Lord will manifeſt that he hath a controverſie againſt them. And ſo much for that third Charge.</p>
                  <p>The fourth follows, and that is, <hi>[Stealing.]</hi> God ſetteth bounds as to mens habitations, ſo to mens eſtates, and he will not have one break, in upon another; no not ſo much as to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:117708:39"/> covet that which is anothers. In ſeeking therefore an encreaſe of our eſtates, to get in any ſinful way, in that we do as it were ſay Gods care is not over me to provide needful things for me, ſeeing I cannot have them from God I will ſee if I can have them from the Devil. This is the language of all kind of gain that we get by any unlawful way; you do not ſay ſo in words indeed, but this is the language of your actions. Saith a poor body, well, I ſee I am in want, I want bread for my family, and cloaths, and many outward comforts, money to pay my Rent &amp;c. I ſee in Gods providence he doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for me, well, I will go unto the Divil then, I will ſee whether the Devill will do more for me than God; I cannot have it by Gods allowance, for if I might have it by his allo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wance I might have it by lawful means, therefore ſaith he I will have it whether God will or no. This is the language of all kind of ſtealing; And the curſe of God is upon that that is got ſo unjuſtly, and all the repentance in the world is not ſufficient for ſuch a man as hath gotten his eſtate unjuſtly, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he make reſtitution of it again to the uttermoſt of his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer.</p>
                  <p>And this ſtealing is not only meant of your Pilferers or Robbers by the high way, or ſuch as cut purſes, but any wrongful gain that is gotten by way of trade. If I were preaching of this argument at large, much might be ſaid to thoſe that live by a way of trade. But for the preſent take that one Scripture, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28.18. <hi>Thou haſt defiled thy ſanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffick.</hi> Let Merchants and Tradeſmen that have gotten any thing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfully, take this text home with them, Thou haſt defiled thy ſanctuaries, by the iniquitie of thy traffick. It may be by trafficking unjuſtly you have gotten ſuch an eſtate, and you come to Gods ſanctuaries as if you were very holy, and no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhould ſuſpect you for your falſe books and gettings that way, God ſaith in this Text that you defile all the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the iniquitie of your Traffick. Perhaps you think af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you have gotten unjuſtly, to give ſomewhat to adorn ſuch a place as this 'tis well enough; but you do defile them.</p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:117708:40"/>
                  <p>So for all kind of oppreſſion, that is meant by ſtealing too. <hi>Latimer</hi> in one of his Sermons before <hi>King Edward,</hi> ſaith, that the greateſt man in the Kingdom cannot hurt an oppreſſing man, ſo as a poor widdow may; and with what arms I pray ſaith he? Can he bring the Judges skin over his ears? The arms are theſe, the tears of the poor run down from their cheeks and go up to Heaven and there cry for vengeance. So that the text here ſpeaks not of the meaneſt but of the greateſt theeves. Saith <hi>Calvin</hi> upon the place, thoſe that had the moſt power by their honor and riches and were oppreſſors of the people, they are the theeves here ſpoken of. And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.23. <hi>Your Princes are rebellious and companions of Theeves.</hi> And <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.1. <hi>When you ſhall ceaſe to ſpoil you ſhall be ſpoiled:</hi> This is a text for our ſpoilers at this day, it may be God will let them go on till they have done their work, and then God cometh upon them, and then, not at the firſt when they begin to ſpoil, but when they have done ſpoiling they ſhall be ſpoiled. Oh this controverſie ſeems to be upon <hi>England</hi> that was threatned and was upon the people in that place we reade of, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.22. <hi>This is a people robbed and ſpoiled, they are all of them ſnared in holes.</hi> If they had come into the field, perhaps it had been better with them, but they crept into holes and they are ſnared and ſpoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: <hi>They are a prey and none delivereth them, they are for a ſpoil and none ſay, reſtore; Who amongſt you will give ear to this?</hi> Mark what the text ſaith, <hi>Who amongſt you will hearken and hear for the time to come? Who gave</hi> Jacob <hi>to the ſpoil and Iſrael to the robbers? Did not the Lord, he againſt whom you have ſinned? for they would not walk in his waies, neither were they obedient unto his Law; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath powred upon them the fury of his anger, he hath ſet them on fire, and who hath laid it to heart?</hi> We are a people robbed and ſpoiled, and it is upon this, becauſe we have not walked in the waies of God nor been obedient to his law, and the Lord hath powred his fury upon <hi>England</hi> at this day, and his fire burneth, and who hath laid it to heart? No body ſtirs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the fire is not kindled in the City you lay it not to heart and you ſuffer your brethren one Country after another to be ſpoiled. Take heed, if you ſtir not more than you have done,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:117708:40"/> as many of you may anſwer for the blood of your brethren, ſo for the ſpoiling of their goods, becauſe you do not lay to heart this heavy judgment that is upon the land at this day, The execution of this controverſie.</p>
                  <p>But yet in times of war you muſt know, that the taking away of all mens goods otherwiſe than meerly by the poſitive Law of the Land, is no ſtealing, nor no breach of the eighth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, for it is againſt common ſenſe and reaſon that in times of war we ſhould be wholly tied to thoſe poſitive Laws of a State that are made for times of peace: But it is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law of Nature, to the Law of God, to the Law of Arms that our enemies ſhould be deprived of what may ſtrengthen them againſt us. Therefore let none cry out of ſtealing and robbing in theſe times; Indeed it is not fit that any ſhould be ſuffered to be as robbers, but yet it is juſt that thoſe that will not be on one ſide ſhould be taken as enemies to the other; and (I ſay) it is agreeable to the Law of Nature, and to the Law of God, and to the Law of Arms, that in times of war, when the war is juſt (in which I hope you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be fully ſatisfied) that what may ſtrengthen the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, may be taken away. Indeed they plead for Law who wholly break it themſelves, becauſe they would have all the priviledg they can to ſtrengthen themſelves by our goods and the goods of others; but certainly God giveth us allowance, being in a lawful war, to ſtrengthen our ſelves by the eſtates and goods of thoſe that appear enemies unto us, without breach of peace or the poſitive Law of the land, or his own Commandement. Thus much for the fourth charge.</p>
                  <p>The fifth is, <hi>[Committing Adultery.]</hi> The generation of a rational creature who muſt live unto all eternity, is a work that God challengeth a ſpecial hand in, to appoint it to all at his pleaſure, therefore the breach of Gods Order in this, and the caſting filth upon this to ſatisfie the brutiſh luſt of a man or woman, it is a moſt curſed evil, againſt which God hath a moſt dreadful controverſie. It is a breach of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Covenant of God, and a ſin that is moſt oppoſite to Gods Nature. And take that text all you that are guilty of this;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:117708:41"/> for perhaps many ſeem not to be guilty, that are profeſſors of Religion and live fairly amongſt their neighbors, &amp; yet may be ſecretly guilty of it too; take that text home with you, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.14. <hi>That the abhorred of the Lord ſhall fall into the pit of the whore.</hi> Go thy waies in that condition wherein thou art, thou canſt know no otherwiſe by thy ſelf but that thou art the man or the woman that art abhorred of God. Thou art beloved of thy Whore, but God abhorreth thee. And <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king upon that place <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.6. <hi>Let no man deceive you with vain words;</hi>

The <hi>Athenians</hi> made a law, That if any man found his wife in the act of <hi>adultery,</hi> he might preſently kill her. And I have read of a people among the Heathens, that have puniſhed this ſin for the filthineſs of it, by putting the adulterers head into the panch of a beaſt where the filth of it lay, and ſo ſtifled him. If Heathens hated it ſo much, ſurely God muſt have a controverſie with thoſe that profeſs themſelves Chriſtians becauſe of this ſin. And the greater controverſie becauſe it is ſo little puniſhed by men. And though many great ones can get beyond puniſhment by man, yet they cannot get beyond this controverſie. I remember Mr. <hi>Cleaver</hi> reports of one that he knew that had committed the act of uncleanneſs, and in the horrour of conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience he hung himſelf, but before when he was about to hang himſelf, he writes in a paper and left it in a place, to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, <hi>Indeed ſaith be, I acknowledg it to be utterly unlawful for a man to kill himſelf, but I am bound to act the Magiſtrates part, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſin puniſhment of this ſin it death.</hi> God would have that ſin puniſhed with death, but the Magiſtrate did not puniſh it
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:117708:41"/> accordingly, therefore he in horrour of conſcience laies vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent hands upon himſelf. We juſtifie not his act, but it ſhews what a controverſie God hath with men that commit this ſin. Thou committeſt that abominable ſin, and thou haſt ſome pleaſure and delight in it, Go thy way, thou art a dead man in Gods eyes, look to thy ſelf, one way or other God may bring death upon thee, and though mans Law take not hold upon thee, God may thou knowſt not how ſoon. I have read of a King of <hi>Navarre</hi> that by adultery had weakned his body very much, and in regard of that, his Phyſitians cauſed his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to be wrapt about with a Cerecloath dipt in Aqua-vitae, and the party that ſowed the Cerecloath, having done, went to burn off the threed with a candle, which preſently took hold of the cloath and conſumed both it and the King.</p>
                  <p>And as God hath a controverſie for this ſin which is ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle puniſhed by mans Law, which by Gods Law is death; ſo the rather hath God a controverſie for this ſin if it be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by men of knowledg, by learned men, by men that are in publick places, by men that carry a ſhew of holineſs, by men that are in the Miniſtry, If they commit it God hath a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full controverſie with them in a ſpecial manner. <hi>Jer.</hi> 29.23. <hi>The Lord make thee like</hi> Zedekiah <hi>and like</hi> Ahab, <hi>whom the King of Babylon roſted in the fire, becauſe they committed villany in Iſrael, and have committed adultery with their neighbors wives.</hi> It was a proverb,<note place="margin">Jer. 29.32. opened,</note>

                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Breaking out is a great aggravation of a mans ſin.</hi> It argueth ſtrength in ſin, impudency in ſin, deſperatneſs in ſin. And this breaking out of ſin is not breaking out only as water in an overflowing time or tide or ſo, but like breaking out of the fire indeed rather, or if you will like water breaking out of ſome fountain; now you know if a water break out of a fountain, there is not the leſs water in the fountain, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an increaſe of it. And as the fire when it breaks out, the breaking out makes it not leſs but more, as when an houſe is on fire it will keep in a long while, but when it breaks out at the roof or ſo then it flames the more and increaſeth with more violence; So it is no diminution to ſin that it breaks out, as many fooliſh people are ready to ſay, that will ſpeak hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible wickedly in their paſſion, I will let it go, as good out as in; they fooliſhly think there is ſo much leſs corruption with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and that is a diminution of ſin, but it is an aggravation of ſin, and noteth impudence in ſin.</p>

But ſome take it thus, one murder follows another, one oppreſſion follows another; <hi>Blood toucheth blood,</hi> now thy wickedneſs is broken out there is no end of it, but one murder follows another. <hi>Pareus</hi> thinketh it hath refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to thoſe times in the 2 <hi>King</hi> 15. where you may reade what murders there were and how blood touched blood at that time, as if the Prophet here had ſaid, they being uſed to murder, there is now nothing but murders, you hear of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in this place, and in that place, and in the other place. Thus we may ſoon have it amongſt us, if the Lord did not raiſe up means to keep in and ſubdue the rage of ungodly men, if it get head and overcome the oppoſition that it hath, blood will then touch blood, one meſſenger ſhall not have done his relation of one horrid and cruel murder, but another meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger will be at his heels to tell you of another more horrid and vile than that. So it is in ſome countries, there comes one
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:117708:43"/> and ſaith in ſuch a place ſuch a man and all his family were murdered, there comes preſently another and tels you in ſuch a Town ſuch a friend of yours was murdered: Thus the meſſegers come at the heels one of another and tell the relation of blood touching blood. So ſome carry it.</p>
                  <p>But I rather thus, they defile themſelves inceſtuouſly (So that this is ſomewhat more than bare adultery) not regarding the neerneſs of blood, but blood toucheth blood, they that were neereſt in blood one to another they mingled themſelves one with onother in filthy and abominable luſts.

That was the moſt then, and little it is that is now, and in that regard we may fear that Gods controverſie is ſo much the more againſt us, and pray to God that ſpeedily the land may deliver it ſelf from this guilt by having ſevere Laws for the puniſhment of this horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble wickedneſs leſt God come and puniſh it himſelf, and then wo unto us.</p>

It referreth unto ſome fearful plague, wherein not only the air but the waters are peſtilential and the cattel and the fiſh die. So it hath been in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, even in <hi>England,</hi> in the time of <hi>Edward the third,</hi> our Chronicles report of ſuch a peſtilential quality that was in

Upon this text he obſerveth ſuch a judgment to be upon thoſe Kingdoms, he obſerveth it not of <hi>England</hi> at all, for he was one that wrote lately, and he had it ſeems ſome hope that <hi>England</hi> was coming to them again.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:117708:51"/> of a true godly Miniſter, that he is in his own cauſe, gentle, yeildable, but when it comes to the cauſe of God, the heat riſeth in his face, and there he hath zeal and fervencie, there he will ſtrive and contend with men in the waies of their ſin.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Obſer.</note>Secondly, <hi>When Miniſters do reprehend and ſtrive with people, they muſt expect to be ſtriven withal by people.</hi> Theſe are as a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that ſtrive with the Prieſt, they have ſuch vile hearts that had they never ſuch faithful and godly Officers that were ſet over them by God, they would ſtrive with them. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all faithful Miniſters muſt expect that if they ſtrive with men for their ſins, men will ſtrive with them. If there had at any time any faithful ones been ſent amongſt them by God, they would have been ready to have cried out of them and have told them, <q rend="inline">You are the cauſe of our miſery, for you will not yeild to <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> you are ſo ſtrict and preciſe, and 'tis you that make this diſturbance, you threaten us that there will judgments come upon us but you are the cauſe of our miſery, were it not for you we ſhould have al the people yeild to what the King hath ſet up, but you ſtir up the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple againſt it and ſo our diſturbance comes from you.</q> Thus no queſtion but they would be ready to ſtrive with the Prieſt at that time. And thus they did with <hi>Amos,</hi> chap. 7. ver. 12. <hi>Go to</hi> Judah <hi>and propheſie there;</hi> they ſtrove with <hi>Amos</hi> that was contemporary with <hi>Hoſea,</hi> propheſying at this time unto this people, the land ſay they cannot bear <hi>Amos</hi> his words, let him go to <hi>Judah,</hi> he were beſt be gone, he tells us we are a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtious people, and that we do not worſhip God in the right manner and in the right place, let him go thither, we wiſh he were out of the Country; he and ſuch as he is raiſe a fire in the land. Thus when Miniſters diſcharge their conſciences ſhewing people their ſins and the mind of God, this is ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily the recompenſe that they have. Thus it was with <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah,</hi> chap 15. ver. 10. <hi>We is me ſaith he, that my mother ever bear me, for I am (ſaith he) a man of ſtrife and of contention to the whol earth, and every one curſeth me.

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:117708:51"/> ſuch hard dealing, and yet he appealed to God in the matter of his ſincerity, he deſired not the evil day, and he prayed for the people ſo long til God bid him pray no more; when thy were railing upon bim he was praying for them. This was the ill condition he was in for that reſpect. And ſo it was with other Prophets beſides him. I might name other texts in <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> as chap. 20. ver. 7.8. <hi>I am in deriſion daily, every one mocketh me, for ſince I ſpake I cried out, I cried, violence and ſpoil, becauſe the Word of the Lord was made a reproach unto me and a deriſion daily;</hi> After I threatned that there ſhould come ſome judgment upon the Nation I cryed out of the violence and ſpoil that they for the preſent made in the Nation, and then they mocked and ſcorned me. The like we have in <hi>Eſa,</hi> he had the ſame dealings from the people. <hi>Eſa,</hi> 28.13, 14.<note place="margin">

                     <hi>But the Word of the Lord was to them precept upon precept, line upon line, here a little and there a little, that they might go and fall backward, and be broken, and ſnared and taken.</hi> You will ſay, how do they ſtrive againſt the Prophet in this? I take it this Scripture is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten miſtaken, and the ſcope of theſe words are to ſhew how the people did jeer and mock the Prophet in his preaching. But the Word of God was to them <hi>precept upon precept,</hi> that is thus,<note place="margin">Opened</note> they ſcorned at Gods Word, What we have nothing but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and precept, one precept after another, in a ſcorning lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, the word of the Lord, and Commandement one after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, and one Propheſie after another, a line upon line, and now you would have a little more; it is ſpoken in a contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning way; And I rather take it to be thus, becauſe in the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew the ſound of the words do carry it in a mocking, in a jeering way, as thus: <hi>trar letrar, kar lekar;</hi>

                  <p>But though wicked men do ſtrive, yet as <hi>Samſon</hi> ſaid unto the men of Judah that came to binde him that they might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver him into the hands of the Philiſtins, <hi>Do not ye fall upon me your ſelves.</hi> It were well if faithful Miniſters were not ſtriven withal many times by thoſe that are godly. It is not ſo much for a faithful Miniſter to have wicked and ungodly men to ſtrive with him. Though they bind them, Oh brethren do not do not you bind them: after that in conſcience of their duty and in love to your ſouls they have hazarded all the hatred and malice that may be of the adverſary, even to ſtand in the fore-front as the But to their mallice, yet in requital of all, even many that are godly, if they ſee them grow troubleſom, they are ready to ſtrive with them; becauſe wicked men are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperated by the Word of God preached, therefore they could wiſh that even ſuch Miniſters had never come amongſt them, and this even ſuch as make profeſſion of godlineſs do.

Well, howſoever Miniſters may meet with hard dealing from ſome, even from profeſſors, yet their way is with the Lord, and their judgment is with the Almighty: As there is a moſt admirable promiſe to help thoſe that have been moſt forward to rebuke ſin &amp; in a zealous way for God, though men are enraged againſt them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.2.<note place="margin">

And this cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly hath been the policie of our Prieſts of late to bring the people into ignorance that ſo they might not be able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with them let then) do what they will. They cry out there was never ſuch a time when every Taylor and every Shop keeper hath had ſo much knowledg that they can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:117708:54"/> their Miniſter as now, and try the Doctrine of their Miniſter. They vex at this that poor men have ſo much knowledg as to be able to trye their Doctrine they preach, they would fain ſo preach as that you muſt be led like a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of ſheep what way they would lead you and beleeve what ever they preach. Certainly ſo many groſs errors and doting conceits of Popery could never have prevailed except they had prevailed with people in their blind obedience. Therefore there may be ſome ſtriving with Miniſters and that according to God, though here their ſtriving is forbidden; As thus, Chriſt requires that his ſheep ſhould know the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between his voice and the voice of a ſtranger: Yea we know that there is a charge that if any preach any other Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine he ſhould be accurſed; even people ſhould look upon thoſe that come to them to preach any other Doctrine as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed; Therefore they are required to know; And they are commanded to try every thing and not to beleeve every ſpirit, yea not to bid them <hi>good ſpeed</hi> that bring other Doctrins; And they are to ſay to <hi>Archeppus, Take heed to thy Miniſtry which thou haſt received that thou fulfil it;</hi> ſo far people have leave. Yet ſtill it muſt be done in waies of reſpect to them. If they look upon them as true Officers (whether they be or no yet if they look upon them as ſuch) the rule will take hold of them, Receive not an accuſation againſt an Elder without two or three witneſſes, You muſt not be ſo ready to ſtrive with thoſe that you look upon as officers. And rebuke not an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but intreat him as a father; It muſt not be in a male pert way but with reſpect and reverence; And when you have done that, contended by witneſſes, and ſpoken to them with reverence as owning the place wherein he ſtandeth, you have liberty then if he bring ill Doctrine, or if his life be naught, to ſtrive with him and conteſt with him in the Name of the Lord, and not to ſuffer your ſelves to be under ſuch bondage as to beleeve what ever they would have you, and they never to be called to any account at all. There was wont robe cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of people if they went from their pariſh Churches (as they called them) Oh it could not be ſuffered, and yet they

Why ſhould one man ſtrive with another, theſe are they that ſtrive with the Prieſt? Though they had never ſo good publick means, they reſiſt that, ſurely then they wil reſiſt private. Therefore publick means is to be preferred before private; When a man can ſpeak as an officer to another, that is more to be regarded and will be more efficacious to thoſe God hath a love unto, than private means. If this be ſo, let parents take heed how they teach their children to deride pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick means: When you have been at a Sermon, perhaps you will deſpiſe what you have heard; It is juſt with God they ſhould, deſpiſe your admonition and reproof, for you have taught them to deſpiſe publick means.</p>

                  <p>Again further, To reject thoſe that we look upon in Office, though their calling be not good, yet it is a wickedneſs that God will revenge, (I ſay) though their calling be not right, if you look upon them or think them to be true Officers, ſo long if you deſpiſe what they do that is according to Gods will, ſo long God will avenge it. If they come in Gods Name and you know nothing to the contrary but that they are true Officers, you muſt not oppoſe them, ſo long as you have any apprehenſions that they are true Officers, though perhaps if they were examined they have no true calling, yet if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee but they have a true calling, you are to have ſuch reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and reſpect unto them, that you are to be ſubject to them.</p>

No we are not ſo in the night, but in the day; we have ſeen the miſery that hath come upon us by a continued deſign, we know almoſt the very bottom the very beginning of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, how it hath gone on by degree, ſtep by ſtep; we ſee now the reaſon of the breaking of it out, becauſe the ſtream is ſtopped it violently breaks out: We know who are the cauſers of our evil, what their counſels, intentions, what their waies are notwithſtanding all their proteſtations, we ſee what we are like to be brought into if we do give but a little way and do not appear to quit our ſelves like men; And we ſee apparantly what God would have us to do; we ſee waies to help us and power to help us if we will, we have power to help our ſelves, and direction to help our ſelves too; we all of us know or may know cleerly what we ſhould do, and

                  <p>Thus the Prophets ſhall fall, but why in the night? Some therefore becauſe they think hard of the different expreſſion, they reade it thus; <hi>You ſhall fall in the day with the Prophet, in

Ill Miniſters God doth beſot them in their very parts and abilities, and they do nothing but cry out ſtill for that which wil bring themſelves and us into ſlavery.

And the truth is at this day the great miſery that is come upon <hi>England</hi> it is through falſe Prophets, through wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Miniſters, through that Doctrine that they have taught. We had never been in ſuch a condition as we are had not they flattered at Court and told at Court that all was at the Kings power and pleaſure, and there ought to be no reſiſtance, and that whatſoever he would have, to refuſe it is rebellion.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The rational creature is very active of it ſelf and will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies be in motion, alwaies working, and it is in the midſt of pits and ſnares, if then it be blind how dangerous will it be for it! As now if you have a metteld horſe that is in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt of deep ſnares and pits, and blind, and he will be curvet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and dancing and will not ſtand ſtill, in what danger is
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:117708:58"/> he? no creature is ſo ful of activity as the rational creature is, he will be active in the world, and then wanting knowledg, in what danger is he?</p>
                  <p>Further, Mans way is for eternity, and there is but one <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> way that leads unto eternity of happineſs, and that way is in the midſt of a hundred croſs waies and by paths. If he have not light, if he want knowledg what ſhall become of him?</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, <hi>Though he be dark himſelf yet he may have ſome others to guid him and ſo he may do well enough.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore conſider in the third place, That man is not only <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> going unto eternity and in dangerous &amp; by waies, but he muſt go with his own light. All the light of all the Angels in Heaven nor of all the Miniſters in the world cannot help a ſoul in his journey to eternity, except this light be conveyed into his own eyes. It is true, a man that is corporally blind he may have help though it be but by a dog, but the ſoul that is ignorant no Angel in Heaven can help it, except it be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of God to bring ſight into his eyes, ſo far it may. But (I ſay) he muſt have light otherwiſe or he muſt periſh, for he muſt go in his way to eternity by his own light.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The work we are to do about our ſouls and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> eſtates it is a moſt curious work, the moſt exact piece that ever was done in the world, and we muſt do it by our own light. Surely if a man were to make a moſt curious piece of work, as a curious Watch or the like, he need have light, put ſuch a one in the dark and what can he do? The work of grace, God muſt enable us to do it, but we muſt work together with God; God enableth a man to make a Watch, he gives him skill, but he muſt work with God: ſo it is with the work of grace, we muſt have light in our own ſouls, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ignorance is dangerous.</p>
                  <p>Further, <q rend="inline">Blindneſs in this world makes men objects of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> pity and compaſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>n, but this ignorance and blindneſs makes men to be the objects of hatred and the curſe of God.</q> When you ſee a poor blind man here, what is he loathſom in your eyes becauſe he is blind, do you hate him? No, you pity him. But now the blindneſs of your ſouls makes you abominable in
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:117708:59"/> the ſight of God, and it is that which God will be avenged on you for. But you will ſay, How can we help it? We have put out our own eyes, God gave us light at firſt and we brought ignorance upon our ſelves.</p>

                  <p>Now this is a great ſin in any but eſpecially in the Prieſts. When others think that the knowledg of God and his truth is too ſlight too mean a thing to take up their thoughts, this is

But I ſay when the Prieſts ſhall reject knowledg, the Prieſts that ſhould have laboured to have fill'd their ſouls with knowledg, if they ſhall ſeek to live bravely, to be gallant, to grow rich, to pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per the fleſh, and care not either to have the knowledg of God in their own ſouls or to bring the knowledg of God unto the people, but look upon them as not worth the regarding, this is in a more ſpecial manner a moſt grievous ſin. How many are there amongſt us at this day that ſtudy to get preferment &amp;c. and then ſell away their books and never after any more mind knowledg! And others if they have knowledg and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and prize it in ſome reſpect, yet in this they contemn it, they prize knowledg meerly as ſervicable unto their luſts. It is not for the beauty and excellency of the knowledg of God that they prize it ſo much, that ſweetneſs that they find in the knowledg of Chriſt that they do ſearch to know, but that they may be accounted Scholers, underſtanding men, learned men. This is to deſpiſe knowledg, when we ſeek for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg but in a way of ſervice unto our luſts, and ſuch men may be charged for men that deſpiſe knowledg.</p>
                  <p>But further, Theſe Prieſts and ſuch as were eminent in Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael rejected knowledg, becauſe they had their houſes and goods and comings in amongſt the ten Tribes. (I beſeech you obſerve it for this concerns us) I ſay the Prieſts that were amongſt the ten Tribes, they were ſetled there and had their houſes and in comes and their eſtates there; but now there was this taught, that we muſt worſhip God at Jeruſalem, at the Temple, they rejected this knowledg eſpecially, they ſaw
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:117708:60"/> that if they did imbrace that truth of worſhiping God in his own way, then farewel our incomes, farewel our livings, farewell our houſes, we muſt leave our brave dwellings and all our maintainance and go from Samaria, and we muſt go to Judah, and how ſhall we live there? Upon this they ſhut their eyes againſt the knowledg of that very truth that ſhould have brought them to the true worſhip of God; Rather than they would loſe their eſtates they would reject that knowledg; And that I think to be the meaning of the holy Ghoſt here, <hi>They deſpiſed as other knowledg,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Text o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</note>

The more meat there is in the pot the more ſcum ariſeth.<note place="margin">ſimile</note> So in <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> great Cities what a great deal of filth is there, filth of ſin, mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> filth: Where there is any confluence of people at Fares and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Merkets in the Country, or in any Corporation, what abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of filth is there continually? As there is any encreaſe in number uſually there is encreaſe in ſin. In Churches, though when they are but ſmall, at their firſt beginning, a few called Saints, they can agree wel together, and go on ſweetly in their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:117708:62"/> way, but ordinarily as they increaſe in number, when Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches grow to any number, they begin to corrupt and increaſe in ſin. They ſhould encreaſe ſo much the more in godlineſs, but this is the corruption of mans heart, every one bringing in ſome corruption, Therefore as there is an increaſe in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſo in ſin.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe that is not the ſcope, but the ſecond, to ſpeak to that a little; As they encreaſed in their proſperous eſtate. For we are to know that at this time the ten Tribes were in a very proſperous condition; they were grown rich and great and ſo they were increaſt, and eſpecially the Prieſts for they had the favour of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and of the Princes; For their main deſign was to uphold their falſe worſhip, and the Prieſts ſerved for their turns moſt, therefore they countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced thoſe Prieſts of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> the Prieſts of the Calves, and they flouriſhed at this time in the Court and in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and were much increaſt in their proſperous eſtate; And as they increaſt ſo they finned. This is mans vile diſpoſition,<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> that encreaſe of mercies ſhould be the encreaſe of their ſin, Thus was it with the Church, when the Church was in a lower condition, then there was more holineſs and more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere love to the truth, when it began to flouriſh in outward proſperity it began to decay in true Piety. And therefore Eccleſiaſtical hiſtories tells us, that when the Church received their donations from Conſtantine of great preferments, then there was heard a voyce in the air: <hi>Hodie venenum infunditur &amp;c.</hi> To day poyſon is powred forth into the Church; when great livings and great eſtates were given to the Miniſters of the Church, then poiſon was powred forth into the Church. It was a good ſpeech of <hi>Boniface</hi> the Martyr,<note place="margin">Boniface.</note> when one asked him whether it were lawful to receive the Communion in woodden Chalices, his Anſwer was, <hi>Time was when in the Church there were woodden Challices and golden Prieſts, but now there are golden Challices, but woodden Prieſts.</hi> And the anſwer of <hi>Aquinas</hi>

It is true in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, in Churches and Countries, but moſt true in Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. It was once a complaint that was made to a Prelate here, that he had a kinſman that was a very zealous preacher in the Countrey, well ſaies he, I'le ſilence him, and his ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing was this, he gave him two livings and that ſtopped his mouth;<note place="margin">

                  <p>God threatneth here that ſeing they did abuſe their proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, as they did encreaſe they ſinned more, <hi>that therefore he would turn their glory into ſhame,</hi> he would caſt dirt into their faces. God doth love to ſtain the pride, the haughtineſs of men. He would turn the glory of the people and the glory of the Prieſts, but eſpecially the glory of the Prieſts (for ſo it is meant, but we muſt take in all) into ſhame; Either firſt he would in ſtead of glory bring ſhame, or ſecondly he would make that wherein they did moſt glory to be their ſhame.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>That he would bring ſhame in ſtead of glory.</hi> So God uſeth to do. If any one glory in beauty, God brings that which makes them contemptible many times in ſtead of that beauty. That is a notable text for women that glory in their beauty and in their bravery, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.16.24. <hi>Becauſe the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:117708:63"/> of Zion are hauty &amp;c. therefore there ſhall be deſtruction upon them;</hi> and ver. 24. <hi>There ſhall be burning in ſtead of beauty, and inſtead of well-ſet hair, baldneſs, and in ſtead of their brave dreſſing, ſackcloth.</hi> If any will glory in parts, the Lord juſtly brings ſhame upon them, blaſting of their parts,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Albertus magnus</hi> nec literas ſciret, ita ignoramus fuit.</note> as it is ſaid of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Magnus</hi> that great Scholer, that for five yeers before his death he did dote and was ſo ignorant that he did not know letters, he could not reade. God can ſoon blaſt the parts of men that glory in them and turn that to ſhame. If any glory in riches, God can ſoon turn that into ſhame too, As hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries tells us of an Earl of <hi>Exceter</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Earl of Exceter</note> that married the ſiſter of <hi>King Edward the Fourth,</hi> and yet <hi>Philip de Commines</hi> reports of him, that he was ſeen begging of his bread in the Low Countries barefoot. God can ſoon take away the riches of men and turn that their glory into their ſhame. And then if any boaſt in honor, glory in that, God can ſoon turn that into ſhame, as in that example of <hi>Herod</hi> that gloried in the applauſe of the people when they cried out <hi>the voice of God and not of man,</hi> and preſently he was conſumed by worms.</p>
                  <p>And much ſhame comes unto men that glory in theſe things, Mark it, according to the glory of men in external things ſo is their ſhame when God takes them away. Here is the difference between the Saints loſing theſe outward things and wicked men. When the Saints loſe theſe outward things there is not much ſhame comes to them, becauſe they did not much glory in them when they had them; but carnal hearts becauſe they know no higher things than theſe things are therefore when they are taken from them there is much ſhame comes upon them, for their glory was in them when they had them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>God makes the very things they glory in to turn to their <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> ſhame.</hi> He doth not only take away their parts and bring ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and dotage inſtead of their parts, but he makes their parts to be their undoing, he makes uſe of their parts to bring them to ſhame. He makes their very riches and honors to be their ſhame, and their glorying in their ſucceſs, he makes that thing turn unto their ſhame; As now, when men
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:117708:64"/> ſhall glory in this that they had ſuch ſucceſs ſuch a victory upon ſuch and ſuch a time, and upon this they gather an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, ſurely God is with us and bleſſeth us and owneth us; in this they glory; well, God turns this into their ſhame when he comes to be againſt them, and blaſts them that they ſhall not have ſucceſs, that it ſhall appear unto all that though they have outward means for advantage yet they go by the worſt; now where is the argument of Gods owning their cauſe,<note place="margin">ſucceſs</note> where is the argument of glorying with them if that were a good argument that God was with them becauſe of their ſucceſs? Thoſe that ſhall make that the only or prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal argument that God is with them, how doth God turn their glory into ſhame when he doth apparantly deny them ſucceſs and that when they have moſt outward advantages for ſucceſs? The Saints ſhame is turned into glory, but the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keds glory is turned into ſhame. When the Saints ſuffer any ſhame for God, they can glory; the Apoſtles they account it their honor, they rejoyce that they were worthy to ſuffer, that they had the honor to ſuffer diſhonor,<note place="margin">

                     </note> ſo the words in the propriety of them ſignifie, they gloried that they bore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them the marks of the Lord Jeſus. Thus what the world accounts their ſhame is their glory,<note place="margin">Act. 5.41.</note> and that which the world judgeth to be their glory is their ſhame.</p>
                  <p>But it is eſpecially meant of the Prieſts, for ſo the Prophet is ſpeaking of them. <hi>God will turn their glory into ſhame.</hi> The Prieſts though they did reject the knowledg of God and their duty, they never regarded to do that wherein the true glory of their office was; That bleſſed knowledg of God that might have made them glorious indeed, that was deſpiſed by them, and the faithful adminiſtration of their office, that was neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by them; Yet they would glory for all this, they would bear it out as if they were THE men; why, they were countenanced at Court,<note place="margin">Obſ.</note> they had good livings and they could lord it over their brethren; and they gloried in that. It is uſual with wicked Prieſts if they can have but countenance from them that are in publick place, and can have but eſtates and livings, though they be never ſo negligent of their office
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:117708:64"/> and never ſo ignorant, yet to glory. How hath it been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us thus of late? How have they carried their heads on high and accounted themſelves the triumphant Church, and all muſt be made to come under them; The land was not able to bear the pride of Prelates and Prelatical men.

God threatneth to turn their glory into ſhame, that is, the glory of their Prieſtly office, for that I think eſpecially to be the meaning of the words, to caſt ſhame and contempt upon the Prieſts. And God doth take much delight in this, to caſt ſhame and contempt upon wicked Prieſts and Prophets, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in <hi>Eſa.</hi> 9.15.

Hence they put on people as much as they could to ſacrifice, teaching them to reſt in their ſacrifices, and indeed making light of their ſin; though you ſin, Come and I will offer for your ſins and they ſhall be pardoned.

                  <p>It is then a moſt curſed thing to deſire or rejoyce in the ſins of others becauſe of our own advantage. That is the ſpecial obſervation here.

I appeal unto you, had you an enemy to you, when you heard of his fall, though it were a ſin againſt God, yet if it tended unto his diſgrace, did not you rejoyce in it? were you not glad of it? becauſe the more an enemy is diſgraced the more you think your ſelf juſtified and honored. Oh this is horrible! Oh be humbled before the Lord for this, and ſeek unto God that if it be poſſible he may pardon the thoughts of thy heart in this thing.

It is a vile and curſed wickedneſs to be glad of the afflictions of our neighbor for our own advantage, much more to be glad of his ſin. When thy neighbour falls into affliction thou ſhouldſt not rejoice at his affliction though thou haſt advantage by it; but when thy neighbor falls into ſin, to be glad of it for thine own advantage, this is a moſt

So for Soldiers to love war,<note place="margin">Souldier</note> and to lengthen out war, and care not what becomes of the lives of men and the woful miſeries of a Kingdom ſo they may have long pay, (I ſay) for them wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to lengthen out war becauſe of their own advantage, this you will all account a great wickedneſs: But this is not ſo bad as to be glad of the ſins of people for our own advantage. Certainly as Chirurgeons that ſhall lengthen out the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Patients for their own advantage may be ſaid to feed, upon the matter and filthy ſtuff of the wound; and Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that ſhall lengthen out war for the encreaſe of their own pay may be ſaid to drink the blood of people; thoſe cups of wine that go down ſo merrily and thoſe diſhes of meat that they are ſo jovial with, may be ſaid to be the fleſh and the blood of people; but this is not ſo bad as to feed upon the ſins of others. Thou that feedeſt upon the ſin of thy brother do thou know that this diet of thine muſt needs breed diſeaſes, It is no wholſom diet to feed upon the ſins of people, it is ſuch a diet as will breed Worms, breed the worm of conſcience one day, and thou wilt get ſuch a ſurfet as will need a ſtrong purge of humiliation to purge thee from that ſurfet. It was once an expreſſion concerning a Prelate that was very fat, one being asked the reaſon why ſuch a Prelate was ſo very fat? why furely (ſaies he wittily) he grows ſo fat by ſo often eating of his own words; but no mervail though men grow to have fat hearts that feed upon the ſins of people. As this is the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary diet'of many, meerly to feed upon the ſins of others, ſo eſpecially of Miniſters, and for Miniſters to feed upon the ſins of people ſo as to keep them alive by their flatteries &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence, that is evil; but if by their faithful preaching they did firſt ſlay the ſins of the people and then receive maintai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for their work, this is allowed by God, and this they may do; when God bad <hi>Peter</hi> ariſe and eat, he firſt bid him ſlay, <hi>Ariſe</hi> Peter <hi>ſlay and eat;</hi>

They will pray to God to forgive them, and ſome go ſo far that they will faſt, and then ſin again, and then pray and faſt again, and then to it again, thinking to put off God with ſuch kind of ſacrifices as theſe are; It is true, we are all linners and we muſt repent, and ſo tin, and repent, and ſin and repent again, and ſo make repentance that ſhould be the death of their ſins a means to nouriſh their ſins. The Prieſts here did abuſe the type, the ſacrifices, they lighten the hearts of people by telling them that there was a ſacrifice to expiate their ſin, and have you not at this day many that abuſe the Antitype as much, that tell the people with ſuch kind of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as there, <q rend="inline">Sin at faſt as you can, there is a ſufficient ſacrifice for ſin, it is but to beleeve in Chriſt, Chriſt hath ſhed his blood for the greateſt ſins of all, and ſin as faſt as you can yet there is a price paid for ſin. It is true there may be ſome truth in the words ſome matter in them without cloathing them with ſuch abſurdities, that is, that there is a ſacrifice for the greateſt ſin, but now to ſpeak to people upon this in ſuch a manner, ſin as faſt as you can there is a ſacrifice for ſin, for it is the manner, the <hi>Modus,</hi> that doth either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage or keep back people from ſin.

The Church hath been continually troubled with this generation, and no mervail there be ſuch men now amongſt us, for there being not yet a full Reformation (for we are but in the way tending toward it) and all things cannot be reformed at once, therefore ſome kind of liberty for the preſent is permitted to ſuch men, and therefore I ſay no mervail that we have ſuch among us that are of ſuch ſpirits to abuſe the free grace of God and lighten the hearts of men in their ſin by telling of them there is a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice in Chriſts death ſufficient to pay for all.

                  <p>Again ſecondly, <hi>[Like people like Prieſt]</hi> In evil in regard <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of the great influence that there is mutualy from the Prieſts to the people and from the people to the Prieſts, ſo they come to be like one another in evil. Sometime from the people to the Prieſts. If people be Malignants and ſuperſtitious and looſe and vain, the Prieſts that are among them being carnal, they will ſeek to humour them; they love to be made of by them and therefore they preach ſuch things as may ſuit with ſuch kind of humours. But this is a very vile thing. It is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream diſhonor to the Miniſtry of the word to ſubject it unto the luſts of men. It is this that makes it ſo contemptible in the eyes of wicked men. Though they be pleaſed with it yet the truth is the ſuiting of their luſts makes the Miniſtry of the word contemptible. How is that you will ſay, they are pleaſed with it, commend ſuch men and like them well? While they commend the men and like them well, yea like what they ſay yet they contemn the Miniſtry, upon this ground,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:117708:70"/> becauſe they come to ſee that even their miniſtry is under their humours, and it is to pleaſe their humours; upon this they look upon themſelves and their luſts as above the Miniſtry, and ſo deſpiſe any authority in it: They are pleaſed with the ſuiting of it to their luſts, but they deſpiſe it in regard of any authority, for they ſee apparantly it is under their hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.

And then verſe 15. <hi>From the Prophet there goes prophaneſs quite thorough the land;</hi> if they be prophane and wicked they have an influence quite thorough the land to make the whol countrey wicked and prophane. And on the other ſide, there is a great influence in the Miniſtry of the word upon people for good many times. If Miniſters continue painful, faithful, conſcionable, it is very rare but that they bring people to ſome kind of obedience or other. Very few godly, conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, powerful Miniſters that have lived any time in any place but they leave ſome ſavour of their ſpirits behind them, that in their people you may find the ſavour of ſuch a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry. It was wont to be ſaid, <hi>Da Ambroſios et habebimus Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doſios</hi> let us have <hi>Ambroſes</hi> and we ſhall have <hi>Theodoſius's.</hi> Let us have godly Miniſters at Court and we ſhall have godly Princes; that is the meaning; The reaſon why <hi>Theodoſius</hi> was ſo good, it was becauſe he had an <hi>Ambroſe.</hi> So we find it in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 12.2. that <hi>Jehoaſh</hi> ſo long as <hi>Jehojada</hi> the Prieſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, ſo long as he had a godly Miniſter with him that inſtructed him, he did that which was right in the eyes of God. No mervail then ſo much evil at Court and other places becauſe we know what kind of Miniſters they ever have had. And becauſe of the influence that a Miniſter hath upon people, hence it is that the evil and malignant party ever deſire to nouriſh theſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; and the force of their rage and malice is againſt godly Miniſters, for like Miniſter like people they think; and indeed ſuppoſing their principles it is but that which is prudential for their ends; for when they cry out and ſay that theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are the cauſe of al, they ſay true, &amp; there is ſome kind of truth in it, that is, they are the cauſe to diſcover to people their evil and wicked waies, and to cauſe thoſe to whom they preach to cleave to the truth, and that is it their ſpirits do vex and rage at, that they ſee the Miniſtry of the Word pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail ſo much upon the people as it doth. Therefore I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber a pulicie that I have read of <hi>Xerxes,</hi> that when he was in ſtraights by reaſon of <hi>Agiſelaus</hi> who prevailed much in his

They went eſpecially for the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſities <hi>Athens</hi> and <hi>Thebes</hi> and there corrupted the Orators and ſo thought to prevail much. It hath been the policie of our men in theſe daies to corrupt Univerſities much, thinking by Scholers and others there to prevail moſt. There is a ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Wolves that they would make a league with the Sheep, but they would by any means have one article gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that was that their Shepheards muſt be delivered up unto them and then they would be at peace with the Sheep and do them no hurt. I make no queſtion but if our adverſaries ſhould come to article with us, there is no one thing they would ſtand more upon than the delivery up of the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards and then there would be good peace between the Wolves and the ſheep. <hi>Like people like Prieſt.</hi>

You will ſay, what great judgment is here threatned that <hi>like people like Prieſt?</hi> Yes certainly to them the judgment was very bitter and grievous, was moſt againſt the hair, for the Prieſts have at all times been puffed up with their callings, ſo that they looked upon themſelves as above the people abundantly, looked down to the people with ſcorn and contempt. The Phariſees in <hi>John,</hi> 7.49. <hi>This peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (ſay they) who know not the Law are curſed,</hi> this ſame vulgar ſort are they that are accurſt; ſo theſe Prieſts here, though the truth is they were made of the vileſt of the people (as they were in <hi>Jeroboams</hi> time, for it is ſpoken of thoſe) yet being once got up into that place they were puffed up as if they had been of another kind of mould than the people were.

It is an evil thing for any in matters that concern the worſhip of God not to take heed of Gods word in it; Though in civil things we are left to prudence and reaſon, but when we come to matter of worſhip we muſt take heed to the word, in every particular that is properly Eccleſiaſtical, that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Church-work, we muſt I ſay in every thing take heed to the Word of God.

Oh it is a dangerous thing when men have a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of errour, or a ſpirit of bitterneſs. You ſhall find ſome men that have much remaining of Antichriſtaniſme in them, do but ſpeak to them of any thing that concerns an Ordinance of Chriſt, of Chriſts inſtitution, of the will of Chriſt in the

So in other things you ſhall find men, and ſome that have good things in them, that if you do but diſcourſe with them of ſome things that you know are according unto the mind of Chriſt, yet they have been brought up otherwiſe and have drunk in other principles, and they have a ſpirit of bitterneſs and anger and vexation that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently will appear in them to caſt off any truth that is ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted unto them.</p>

It is ſacrifice, and you cannot ſay but we ſacrifice to the true <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> God, we do not ſacrifice to Idols, why do we go a whoring from God then?

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:117708:83"/> Miniſtry indeed. Thus the Prophet doth, you ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice upon the mountains and high places and under the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of every tree. <hi>Hierom</hi>

                  <p>But to open this Scripture yet more cleerly, to ſhew where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their ſin lay here, that they ſacrificed upon the mountains and hills and under trees. For that, we are to know that in former times before the Ark and the Tabernacle and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was built, it was lawful to ſacrifice in any place, and God approved of ſacrificing in mountains, and did direct <hi>Abraham</hi> to go and ſacrifice his ſon upon a mountain, upon <hi>Moriah, Gen.</hi> 22.2. And we reade of <hi>Abrahams</hi> planting a grove when he called upon the name of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.33. So that the forefathers did ſacrifice upon mountains, and they planted groves and trees by the places where they ſacrificed; there was no hurt then in ſuch things. But afterward God prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biteth this, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.13.14. <hi>Take heed to thy ſelf that thou offer not thy burnt offerings in every place that thou ſeeſt, but in the place which the Lord ſhall chuſe in one of thy tribes, there thou ſhalt offer thy burnt offerings.</hi> God would limit them the place of his worſhip. When the Ark was made and the Tabernacle they were bound to come to that and ſacrifice there and no where elſe, and ſo when the Temple was built they were bound to come thither and to ſacrifice there and no where elſe. Yea then the Lord commanded them to pull down the high pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, and to cut down the groves and trees, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.2. <hi>Ye ſhall utterly deſtroy all the places wherein the Nations which ye poſſeſs ſerved their gods, upon the high mountains, and upon the hills, and under e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very green tree.</hi> When once God had appointed a place of worſhip then they were to deſtroy the other places where the Heathens were wont to worſhip their gods.</p>
                  <pb n="143" facs="tcp:117708:83"/>
                  <p>The Note is this from it, <hi>When once God chuſeth places or things, when God once putteth a ſtamp of holineſs upon places or things,</hi>

                     <hi>then no men may chuſe places or things and put ſuch a ſtamp of holineſs upon them as God hath put.</hi> If God appointeth a way of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of his own, this ſtops us from all other of our own. If God makes a place holy this ſtops us that we muſt never make any place holy but that; ſo it is true of things, of ceremonies, any thing, if once God ſets a ſtamp upon a thing to make it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we muſt confine our ſelves to that, and not think to immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate God in it, to make any thing of the ſame kind to be holy as God hath done. It was now a ſin for them, and God ſtands much upon circumſtances we ſee in his worſhip. You ſhall have many men plead why ſhould men be ſo ſtrict and ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to ſtand upon circumſtances? what muſt we have every circumſtance in the word of God commanded? My brethren, that which is natural and moral and may be ſubſervient to religious things, may be left (it's true) unto prudence, but whatſoever hath any Religion in it, though it be but a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, God ſtands much upon it, and we muſt have a Divine rule for it. <q rend="inline">Natural circumſtances, moral, civil, circumſtances, prudence is enough to guide us in, but any religious circumſtance we muſt have a rule for it.</q> Here they are not accuſed for ſacrificing the things they ought not to ſacrifice, no queſtion but they offered thoſe ſacrifices which they were commanded, ſheep and beeve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Yet there were ſome of the Kings that were very careful in this thing, As amongſt the reſt <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Jehoſaphat. He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 18.22. where he is charged by <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> for taking down the high places, <hi>Is it not he that hath deſtroyed the high places and Altars of God ſaith he?</hi> God approveth of it well though <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> thinks he hath done ill; Oh ſaith he, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah,</hi> do you truſt in him? he hath taken down the high places. He thought that <hi>Hezekiah</hi> had been an enemy unto Religion and to the worſhip of God for taking down the high places. Thus it is with ignorant people at this day that do not know the way of Gods worſhip; becauſe ſome in autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (as the Parliament) ſeek to take away corruption in the worſhip of God,<note place="margin">Parliam</note> abundance of people cry out that they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies unto all Religion, that they will take away all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Thus it is reported by your countrey people that dwel far off, as in <hi>Wales</hi> and in other places, the people are there perſwaded that the Parliament are a company of vile men that ſeek to take away all Religion out of the Kingdom. But this is ſo but in the underſtanding of a <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> that thinks the taking away of high places to be the taking away of Religion.</p>
                  <p>The other King is <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> that is commended for taking away the high places, and it is noted of him, that his heart was lifted up more than ordinary in the waies of God when he did it; For this ſacrificing upon the high places was ſuch a thing that the people were ſo ſet upon it, what ſay they, is it not a brave decent thing that we ſhould go up to a high place
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:117708:85"/> to offer unto the high God? therefore when <hi>Jehoſahhat</hi> took them away the text ſaith, his heart was lifted up in a more than ordinary manner. So it ſhould be with Governours when they ſee corruptions in Gods worſhip, though the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſtick cloſe to them, yet they ſhould have their hearts lifted up with courage and zeal to go on in the work. <label type="milestone">

                     </label> In 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.6. there you have it, <hi>His heart was lifted up in the waies of God, Moreover he took the high places and groves out of Judah.</hi> Here is two things that Iſrael is charged for, the high places, and the groves, <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> took away, and he took them away out of Judah. He was of a lift up mind and his heart took boldneſs for the waies of God, ſo the old Latine hath it. But mark, what courſe, what way did <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> take to remove the high places and the groves? In the 7. verſe of that chapter you find this, <hi>He ſent to his Princes to teach in the Cities of Judah.</hi> Mark here, Princes are become Preachers; <hi>He ſent to his Princes to teach in the Cities of Judah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Princes preachers</note>

If he had only by an Edict removed them he could not have done ſo much, but he took this wiſe courſe, he ſent faithful Preachers thoroughout all the Countrey, in all the great Cities eſpecially. He was careful they ſhould have faithful Preachers and then the work would be eaſily done. So that it appears it was becauſe of the ill Preachers they had before or becauſe they had no Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers at all that the high places were ſo hard to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way.

                     </note> to take away corruptions from the worſhip of God, if in all Cities and Towns there were faithful Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers! For we ſee apparantly that people that have been brought up in ignorance they ſtick moſt to theſe things.

<pb n="147" facs="tcp:117708:85"/> They would I ſay be convinced of this if they had teaching. This was <hi>Jehoſaphats</hi> way, and Oh how happy were it if we took the ſame courſe? But there is one thing more obſervable it is ſaid in this 7. chapter that <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> took away the high places; but in Chap. 20. ver. 33.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17. with cap 20.33 reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</note> it is ſaid he took them not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; but how is it?

Now for the reconciling of theſe two places, it ſeems <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> did what lay in him, In chap. 17. therefore God accounts it as being done for his part, but becauſe when he had done what he could yet the people were ſo ſtubborn and ſtout and would not yeild to the command of the King, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this 20. Chapter it is all layed upon the people; As if God ſhould ſay, they were not taken away becauſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had not prepared their hearts, but as for <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> he did what lay in him for the taking them away. God will accept of the intention of Governours, Let them do what they can in it and if it be not done the fault will lie where the cauſe is. You may ſee by this that people may hinder the work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation much, <hi>their hearts were not prepared,</hi> that is, they were not fit to receive ſuch inſtructions as were ſent unto them. And truly in <hi>England</hi> many people are not yet prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to receive the work of Reformation. We never read (that is obſervable too) of any difficulty of any of the Kings either of Judah or Iſrael to bring in any falſe worſhip, obſerve it in all the ſtories of the Kings or Chronicles when there was any King that would bring in any falſe worſhip there was never a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny difficulty in it;<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> But when good Kings did ſeek to bring in true worſhip and to caſt out falſe, it was too difficult a work for them.

                     </note> The Heathens did conſecrate many trees <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to their Idols.

                  <p>Secondly, They ſacrificed there in imitation of the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches, as I ſhewd before, <hi>Abraham</hi> built a grove by the Altar he made; and ſo many of the Patriarchs had groves and trees by their Altars, and in imitation of them they did it, and ſo did the Heathens, for the Devil did ſtrive much to imitate the way of the true worſhip of God, but now when they came once to abuſe the ancient practice of the Patriarchs, God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves it.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They thought that dark and ſhady places, dark <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> by the ſhadineſs of theſe trees, might ſtrike ſome fear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence in the hearts of men when they came to worſhip, there is a kind of diſmalneſs as it were, and it doth cauſe a kind of reverence in coming into woods where there are high trees and ſhady places, there is a kind of ſolemneſs in it, and they thought it was a means to put reverence into the hearts
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:117708:87"/> of the worſhippers. Even Heathens themſelves when they worſhipped their Idols they ſought to have the hearts of the worſhippers to be fild with reverence. And,</p>

Take ſome geſture, ſuppoſe it were indifferent, ſuppoſe it were lawful ſome way; but if you take it up thus, to think that by it you put more reverence and reſpect upon Gods worſhip than there is, there you ſpoil it; upon ſome other grounds it may perhaps be granted, but upon that ground you ſpoil it quite.

                  <p>Firſt, <hi>They did not underſtand the deſign that</hi> Jeroboam <hi>had and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> thoſe Princes that followed him.</hi> Poor ſimple people they were led by vain pretences, <hi>Jeroboam</hi> he pleaded this, that he was for the true Religion, he was for the worſhiping of the true God, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he would not have the people ſo tired as to go up thrice a yeer to Jeruſalem, that was not ſo neceſſary.

                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>They did not underſtand theſe four things, and for not underſtanding theſe four things they ſhall fall. This was that which brought them down and did ruin this people.</p>
                  <p>There are divers degrees of not-underſtanding.</p>

And this want of underſtanding is like to cauſe us to fall.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, People underſtand not that the worſhip of God muſt have the word of God to be the rule, and that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church muſt be according to the word. They think what ſhall be moſt ſutable to the reaſons of underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding men that is beſt. Becauſe men underſtand not this we are in danger to fall.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, People at this day think there is too much to do about Religion, and let us rather go in a way of policy to provide for our ſelves, as for that why ſhould we injure or
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:117708:96"/> trouble our ſelves ſo much? we have troubled our ſelves too much already. People think not their ſafety is in Religion therefore they ſhall fall.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, people think if they be taught ſo by their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that's enough for them. Is it not ſo with us now? Therefore we have cauſe to fear that the Lord intendeth us a grievous fall.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, Judah was in great danger to be drawn aſide by <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Iſrael, becauſe that Iſrael was the greater number. Iſrael was ten Tribes, but Judah and <hi>Benjamin,</hi> thoſe two Tribes, little <hi>Benjamin</hi> together with Judah were but a few in compariſon of Iſrael. It is a great argument that Idolaters uſe to draw others unto the waies of Idolatry becauſe of the number of thoſe that go that way.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note> 
                     <hi>The whol World admire after the Beaſt;</hi> the World doth, the Nations do, and that is a mighty argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to draw; the greater part of people they think that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

No queſtion but it was their argument here, as if they ſhould ſay, what, do not ten Tribes know the mind of God as well as thoſe two? Is there any reaſon why we ſhould think that the greater part of the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> of the Jews, ten Tribes ſhould not know the mind of God? It is the argument at this day (ſay many that are ſuperſtitious and would go on in their old way of Idolatry) They that are againſt ſuch waies they are but a few, an inconſiderable party, but the chief, the great ones and the moſt of all ſorts you ſee which way they go. We are to take heed of this. Oh let not Judah though Iſrael be the greater part follow a multitude to do evil.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Iſrael was rich and in a flouriſhing eſtate, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> there was danger that Judah might be carried away by them. Iſrael carried things before them in outward pomp and glory, and we know that way that thrives in the world,

We find it by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, let a way be perſecuted yet let it be but once counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced in the world, men will cry it up; do we not ſee at this day that thoſe things that heretofore men would not profeſs, becauſe of perſecution, that now on a ſudden their minds are changed and now they cry it up? The ſame thing that heretofore have been perſecuted, if they once be but coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by great ones and by multitudes, how will men cry it up! Things that their hearts were againſt, things that they would argue and reaſon againſt, yet now becauſe they have more publick countenance, their judgments are changed; here is the deceit of mens hearts, that way that hath moſt counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance in the world, that way they will go on in, eſpecially in the worſhip of God.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fiftly, Iſrael had many colours and pretences for what th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                     <hi>The neerer any come to you in what is the right worſhip of God, yet if they retain any corruption, there is ſo much the more danger that they ſhould draw you from that which is right;</hi> for Iſrael did come neerer to the true worſhip of God than the Heathens did, now the Prophet doth not ſay, though the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens be Idolaters, yet let not Judah be ſo too, but <hi>though Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend.</hi> There was more danger that Judah ſhould be drawn aſide by Iſrael than that they ſhould be drawn aſide by any of the Heathen.

                  <p>Well, Judah muſt not do ſo though Iſrael doth. As there were many things wherein Judah was in great danger to be drawn aſide by Iſrael; ſo there were many arguments why Judah ſhould not do as Iſrael did.<note place="margin">Expoſit.</note> As</p>
                  <p>Firſt, God had graciouſly differenced Judah from Iſrael <label type="milestone">

God had in mercy made a difference between Judah and Iſrael, let not then the wickedneſs of their hearts make themſelves to be all one. God had kept Judah to the houſe of <hi>David</hi> and to his Temple, to be his own people.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Judah had more means than Iſrael had, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <label type="milestone">

Whatſoever Iſrael doth that have none but ſuperſtitious Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Prieſts amongſt them, Prieſts made of the loweſt of the people, Iſrael that hath but the Calves and hath not the right Ordinances of God among them, whatſoever they do, yet let not Judah offend that have the true Ordinances of God and the true Prieſts and Miniſters of God among them.<note place="margin">Obſerv.</note>

                  <p>Thirdly, Judah was not compell'd by her Governours to <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>3</label> do ſo as Iſrael, for Iſrael you know by <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and other of the Princes was compeld to do what they did, and they might
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:117708:100"/> pretend that it was for their own ſafety, to ſave their lives and to ſave their eſtates: but there was no ſuch neceſſity for Judah to do it, for God many times ſent godly and gracious Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to Judah, and there was not ſuch waies there to compel them, they were not ſo neceſſitated to that way of falſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip as Iſrael was, (if we may call it any neceſſity to that which is evil.<note place="margin">Obſer.</note>) When people have liberty and are not forced but God doth give them liberty that they need not (except they will) be Idolaters, yet for them to cloſe with waies of I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry and ſuperſtition, when they need not, this is more ſinful. It is true, heretofore there might have been ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe, we were forced to it, it was as much as our eſtates were worth, we muſt have been caſt into priſon and perſecuted, and that made us do that we did. The Lord be merciful to us for that we rather than we would ſuffer would joyn in thoſe ſuperſtitious waies that were amongſt us. But now thorough Gods mercy we are delivered from that bondage, we are not ſo compel'd, yet that now for all this our hearts ſhould yet cleave to thoſe old ſuperſtitious waies, this makes our ſin ſo much the greater.</p>

                  <p>From hence theſe Notes are to be obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, We muſt not do as others do, eſpecially in point of <label type="milestone">

Indeed the conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on how others ſin againſt God ſhould be ſo far from being an argument to draw us unto ſin, as it ought to be the greateſt argument to draw us from ſin; Thus, every ſin againſt God it is a ſtriking at God.<note place="margin">ſimile</note> It's true if there be a common enemy come into a City or Town, every one deſires to have a blow at him, and when men make this an argument for their ſin be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe others do it, they deal with God as thoſe in a Town would deal with a common enemy, that is thus, why ſuch and ſuch and ſuch go on in ſuch wicked waies, they ſtrike at God, therefore let me ſtrike at God too, when thou pleadeſt that argument and ſaieſt becauſe ſuch and ſuch do ſin there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I may ſin, thou doeſt in effect as much as ſay ſuch and ſuch ſtrike at God let me have a blow at him too.

For ever take heed of pleading the example of others in waies of wickedneſs, and remember this one expreſſion that thou doeſt in effect as if thou ſhouldſt ſay, others about me they ſtrike at God and I muſt have my blow at him too as well as they. In any ſin we muſt take heed of example, but above all in matters of worſhip. Hence <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.30. <hi>Take heed to thy ſelf that thou be not ſnared by following of

God would not have us uſe that argument. Take heed therefore of pleading thus, other people do ſo and ſo and other Nations, why may not, we do as other Nations do? It is a very ill argument to plead example in matters of worſhip, I mean that worſhip that here Judah is forewarned of, that is, worſhip that is by inſtitution, and above all things the examples of men are not to be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in points of inſtitution. In any thing in the world there may be more plea for example than in inſtituted worſhip and the reaſon is this,<note place="margin">Note</note> Becauſe that other things have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of them written in the Law of nature in mans heart, all matters of morallity are in ſome degree or other written in mans heart by nature, every man hath ſomewhat of the moral Law written in his heart, but inſtitutions they are ſuch things as depend meerly upon Gods revealed will and are not written in the heart of man: Therfore though we might have a plea to follow the example of others in point of morality, yet there can be no juſt plea to follow the example of others in point of Inſtitutions, there we muſt be ſure to keep to the rule of Gods Word, to look above all things in points of Inſtitution, to what is written and never to make it an argument that ſuch or ſuch people do ſo and ſo.

                     <note place="margin">Beth aven</note> was no other than that Town which ſo often in Scripture was called <hi>Bethel,</hi> which <hi>Bethel</hi> ſignifies the houſe of God, and it had that name given unto it by <hi>Jacob</hi> upon Gods extraordinary appearing to him when he fled becauſe of his brother <hi>Eſau, Gen.</hi> 28.

Therefore oathes are to be eſteemed ſo much the more ſacred; For as God puts an honor upon prayer, that ſometimes all the worſhip of God is called <hi>prayer, He that calleth on the Name of the Lord ſhall be ſaved; My houſe ſhall be called the houſe of prayer &amp;c.</hi> So God puts this honor upon <hi>Oathes,</hi> that all his worſhip hath ſometimes the name of an Oath.

And here is the reaſon that we muſt ſwear by none but by God, becauſe in ſwearing (I ſay) we do acknowledge him we ſwear by to be the ſearcher of our hearts, the witneſs of all our ſecrets, and the ſupream Judge if we be unfaithful; Now this honor is only due to God whether ſecret or open. God accounteth much of this his honor and will not give it to another. And when we do ſwear by the Name of God, the <hi>Life of God</hi> is the greateſt title we can give to God in an Oath. It is the greateſt Oath of all,<note place="margin">Living <hi>God</hi> what it implies.</note> God himſelf doth often ſwear by his life, and the Angel ſweareth by the living God. God loveth that his creature ſhould acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him to be the living God for ever, that is to live to reward that which is good, and to revenge that which is

This was the guize of thoſe Idolaters, though they forſook the true worſhip of God and his commandement, yet they would ſeem to honor God much, <hi>the Lord liveth,</hi> and we deſire to honor this living God. Now ſaith God, what do you go on in ſuch waies of Idolatry as theſe and take my Name into your mouths? what have you to do to take my Name into your mouths ſeeing you hate to be reformed?

                  <p>You have heard before that God gives warning unto Judah to take heed of the ſins of Iſrael, of the ten Tribes; And ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny arguments are uſed; ſome you have heard, and others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.</p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:117708:110"/>
                  <p>This 17. verſe hath two ſtrong arguments for it.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Ephraim</hi> is joyned to Idols, <hi>Ephraim</hi> engaging him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> in that way of falſe worſhip is now ſo in wrapped in that ſin and guilt that he cannot tel how to get out, he is joyned to it:<note place="margin">Note</note> As it is the way of Idolaters and the curſe of God upon them, that when they are once got into that ſin it is very hard ever to recover them out of it. Take heed Judah that you come not into it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As he is joyned ſo, being ſtrongly ſet upon his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Idols, ſo the Lord hath given him up to his Idols. There is this curſe of God upon him to ſay, <hi>Let him alone.</hi> Oh Judah take heed what you do then. So that theſe words are brought in as two arguments to perſwade Judah not to do as Iſrael hath done, and indeed all the remainder too of this Chapter is brought in this way.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak then of theſe:</p>
                  <p>Ephraim <hi>is joyned to Idols] Ephraim,</hi> why <hi>Ephraim</hi> was dead long ago, <hi>Ephraim</hi> was one of the Patriarches, the child of a Patriarch at leaſt, he was the grand-child of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and he had a great bleſſing upon him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.20. <hi>In thee ſhall Iſrael bleſs, and ſhall ſay, God make thee like</hi> Ephraim. <hi>Ephraim</hi> had a ſpecial bleſſing upon him, ſuch a bleſſing as that the reſt of the Tribes ſhould ſay, <hi>God bleſs thee, and make thee like</hi> Ephraim (for <hi>Joſephs</hi> tribe was in <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Mannaſſes:</hi>) and yet now it is ſaid, that Ephraim <hi>is joyned to Idols.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why <hi>Ephraim?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Becauſe that the chief of the ten Tribes that were now joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Idols were the children of <hi>Ephraim,</hi>

From whence the firſt Note is this. That</p>

                  <p>Secondly, All the ten Tribes were joined to Idols, why then <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Expoſit. </seg>2</label> is <hi>Ephraim</hi> named rather than any of the other? The reaſon is this, becauſe that <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and the Princes were all of the tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> and therefore all is put upon them. He doth not ſay the ten Tribes are joyned to Idols, but <hi>Ephraim</hi> is, becauſe indeed the Idolatry of all the other nine Tribes was from the Idolatry of <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and the Princes that were of the Tribe of <hi>Ephraim.</hi> From whence another Note is this, That,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Governours of people are uſually the cauſes of the evil of the <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſ. </seg>2</label> people, and eſpecially in the point of falſe worſhip.</hi> If Governours be ſuperſtitious and Idolaters, if they will favour Idolatry, all the people uſually or the generallity of them will go that way. They contract the guilt of the Idolatry of all the falſe worſhip of the people. <hi>Ephraim</hi> doth, <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that were of that Tribe contracts all the guilt of the Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of all the ten Tribes, therefore it is ſaid <hi>Ephraim</hi> only, as if only <hi>Ephraim</hi> was joyned to Idols. Governours therefore that are ſuperſtitious and Idolatrous have woful guilt upon them, and we have cauſe to lament their condition exceedingly. We reade in that ſecond of <hi>Matthew</hi> where the wiſe men came to enquire after the King of the Jews, they came from a far Countrey, they ſaid they had ſeen his ſtar and they deſired to know where the place was that he ſhould be born in: It was a mighty work, &amp; ſuch a work as did trouble <hi>Herod,</hi> and al <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with him was in a mighty trouble what this ſhould be, a ſtrange thing, that ſuch wiſe men ſhould come ſo far, from a far Country, and tell us of a ſtar that appeared, and that a King of the Jews ſhould be born, all the people were troubled together with the King, ſo as that they called a counſel of all the chief Prieſts and the Scribes and ſuch as were expert in the Law, to know where Chriſt ſhould be born, and this Counſel told them that the place was to be in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and upon that the wiſe men according to their direction or according to the ſtar,<note place="margin">Note</note> went to find out the place; But mark, you do not reade of any one of all the people of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that went with the wiſe men; Although they were ſtirred at it and thought it a
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:117708:111"/> wonderful work that a ſtar ſhould thus appear, and that theſe wiſe men ſhould come and enquire for the King of the Jews, and that their own Teachers ſhould tell them that he was to be born at <hi>Bethlehem</hi> and thereupon they went to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to ſearch it out, yet (I ſay) we do not reade that any of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple went with them; No, they durſt not becauſe of <hi>Herod, He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rod</hi> that was then their Prince he did not frame that way, and therefore not one of the people would follow after the wiſe men to ſearch after Chriſt. So it is uſual, that when Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors diſcountenance the waies of God, the people generally do as they do; And eſpecially Governours that are in waies of ſuperſtition and Idolatry, and together with thoſe waies ſhall give people liberty to ſatisfie their luſts, then they will cleave unto them indeed, as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> and the reſt of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces did, they ſet up a falſe way of worſhip and together with that they gave libety unto the people to ſatisfie their luſts, as appeared partly before and will further appear in this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie; And this was one ſpecial way by which they gained the hearts of the people to them in their falſe worſhip becauſe they gave ſcope and liberty to their luſts. Let any Princes and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors ſet up and countenance any falſe way of worſhip, and together with it give liberty to the people for the ſatisfying of their luſts and they will gain enow unto them, there is no cauſe to wonder that ſuch Princes ſhould have ſo many to cleave unto them, ſeeing the people know that by cleaving un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them they ſhall have liberty to enjoy their luſts.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, There is a reprobation in it in this regard, That God now doth manifeſt that he doth intend to fetch his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from this ſinner out of his ruin, he manifeſteth no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther now; for thus, Certainly God will have glory from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very creature, howſoever you may reſiſt God in his glory, God will have it, he will fetch it out from you; Well, but now on the firſt hand, God he would have his glory from his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the waies of obedience and ſervice, but they deny this to God, they will not give him this glory, they will have their own will, they will ſet up themſelves in Gods Throne: Well ſaith God, I have uſed ſuch and ſuch means to draw their hearts from thoſe waies to my ſelf, but they ſtand out, <hi>Let them alone now,</hi> As if he ſhould ſay thus, I have thought now of another way to fetch out my glory from them, as he reaſoned in the Goſpel, when he could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for himſelf one way, I know what I will do ſaith he; ſo ſaith God, I am denied my glory one way, well I know what to do, I have another way, that is, to glorifie my infinite Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice and the power of my infinite wrath; they have refuſed to give me glory by obedience and coming in to me, I will not have my glorie that way, but now I will rather chuſe to have my glorie from them in their everlaſting miſery, they ſhall be ſpectacles of my wrath and juſtice, and it ſhall be known to Angels and men unto all eternity what my infinite juſtice and power is able to do, therefore let them alone to that ſaith God.</p>

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:117708:118"/> this tended to the deſtruction of the fleſh though to the ſaving of their ſoul; yea but they would rather live in proſperity and eaſe and have their ſin; well ſaith God, you ſhall do ſo, you ſhall have eaſe and proſperity and have your ſin, that is, your fleſh ſhall here be ſaved, but your ſoul ſhall eternally be deſtroyed.

Now all means are not only unprofitable, thoſe means that do other ſouls good; It may be the poor child of a wicked parent comes unto the word, and there he finds God revealing himſelf unto him; and the Spirit of God drawing his heart unto himſelf; but there is his parent of whom God hath ſaid, <hi>Let him alone,</hi> he ſits under the means and gets no good: So perhaps the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, he is one upon whom this judgment is paſt, <hi>Let him olone,</hi> he ſits under the means and gets nothing, and his poor ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant he comes and his ſoul is enlightned, his heart is enlarged becauſe this judgment is not upon him.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Cauſes of ſhame.</note>There are four things that principally cauſe ſhame.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, <hi>Diſreſpect from thoſe we deſire honor from,</hi> that is ſhame: When one comes to any, to a ſuperior, and expects reſpect from him, and finds that he is caſt out, this is a great ſhame. So they ſhall be aſhamed of their ſacrifices, they make account that I ſhould honor their ſacrifices, that they ſhould have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor from me by reaſon of their ſacrifices, but I will caſt ſhame upon them, they ſhall have nothing but arguments of diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect from me. In 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2.16. when <hi>Bathſheba</hi> came to <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> to ask a Petition of him, <hi>deny me not</hi> ſaith ſhe; the old

When God doth caſt off the ſacrifices of men and ſhews diſreſpect unto them, that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſhame, it doth confound or ſhould confound their faces.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>When a man takes a great deal of pains and it comes <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> all to nothing,</hi> that cauſeth ſhame; and ſo all ſuperſtitious waies will bring ſhame at laſt. In <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2. it is ſaid of all ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious ceremonies that they periſh in the uſe of them, there comes no good of them. Idolaters take a great deal of paint in their waies of falſe worſhip, but all will come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; when they ſhall ſtand in moſt need all their waies of ſuperſtition and Idolatry will leave them ſhiftleſs and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courleſs, and helpleſs, and ſo caſt ſhame upon them.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Diſappointment of hope brings ſhame. Pſal.</hi> 119.116. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>Let me not be aſhamed of my hope</hi> ſaith <hi>David,</hi> If I hope for good and be diſappointed, this will bring ſhame. Divers Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures we have to ſhew this. So when thoſe that are ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious and Idolatrous ſhall raiſe up their hearts with great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of good from God in their waies of falſe worſhip and ſhall be diſappointed of all their hope, in this God will caſt ſhame upon them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>When God diſcovers that to be worthleſs and vile <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> which a man hath gloried moſt in;</hi> that cauſeth ſhame. So Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters that glorie in their Idolatrous waies, the Lord in time will diſcover them to be baſe and vile and worthleſs things, for indeed they are all but poor apiſh and beggarlie things, and they ate fitter to pleaſe children than God.

Many people they cry out we are at a loſs, we know not what to do, we have rejected indeed falſe worſhip and in ſome meaſure we ſee that that is vile, but we know not what way to ſet up in Gods houſe, what are the forms and faſhions thereof; and the hearts of people tremble to think what may come to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, fearing leſt things will not be found out, fearing

Many of us think when we have been in a day of faſting and ſpent a whol day in it, and our hearts have been let out and we have been enlarged and have offered up a great ſacrifice to God, that we may take the more liberty afterward; No, though you offer twenty two thouſand Oxen and an hudred and twenty thouſand ſheep yet if after this at all thou ſhalt forſake me, all that thou haſt done ſhall be rejected.

Therefore you that are poor people and weak parted, and have but little grace, yet if you have true grace, though you cannot offer up ſuch large prayers, your heart is not ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged perhaps as others are, and you look upon your ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices as poor and mean and as unworthy to be tendered up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the great God, but doſt thou then offer up thy ſelf unto God as a ſacrifice?

When Souldiers offend if there be multitudes of them in the ſame offence and they cry, One and al, there is no med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling then with any of them. But it is not ſo with God, God regards not multitudes and generality of all ſorts, when all ſorts are involved in the offence. Men think, I do but as others do, and I ſhall ſcape as well as others: With men it is ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what, but it is nothing with God; though all ſorts offend yet there is never a whit the more ſecurity thereby unto any.

This he ſaid to a great King. Great liberty have others had in the Primitive times to ſpeak thus unto Princes; And a great cauſe of the evil of theſe latter daies hath been the flatteries of thoſe that have been at Court, therefore ſaith the Prophet here, Hear ye Oh houſe of the King.

But I rather think that here it is to be taken paſſively, that is, that God calls you to judgment, to ſuffer Judgment, judgment is toward you,<note place="margin">Note</note> or againſt you. And obſerve I beſeech you the difference between the beginning of the fourth Chapter and the beginning of the fifth. In the fourth Chapter it was but a controverſie, a ſtrife that God had with them, <hi>Hear the Word of the Lord, ye children of Iſrael, for the Lord hath a controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie with the land:</hi> But here you have another word, now it is come to judgment; that which before was but a contending with them is now come to a judgment of them, to a paſſing of ſentence upon them, judgment is againſt you, ſentence is out upon you. The former was Gods pleading againſt them, and this now is Gods judging of them. <q rend="inline">When God pleadeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us (that is the Note from thence) let us not neglect his pleas,<note place="margin">Obſerv. Gods pleadings</note> for they will come to a ſentence and then we are gone.</q> If we neglect when he begins to plead his cauſe with us, if we neglect it becauſe judgment is not upon us, it will proceed to a ſentence. God hath laid his plea againſt many a man in his Word, and perhaps ſome of you ſee it and know
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:117708:134"/> it that God hath laid his plea againſt you; and God laies his plea againſt many a man in his conſcience, but he nelgecting this plea of God laid againſt him in his Word and in his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, he hath afterward received the ſentence of death in his ſoul which hath ſunk his heart into diſpair. Many a man hath had God ſpeaking againſt him in his word and in his conſcience I ſay, and there hath been Gods controverſie, God hath been laying his plea there, thou haſt gone on in thy ſin, and at length it may be there comes the ſentence of death up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thy ſoul, that thou doeſt as it were feel, ſom have ſaid it,<note place="margin">The ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation felt</note> that they have felt God paſſing a ſentence of death upon them, and ever after that ſpeech they have roared out through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair and ſo have died. There hath been ſuch works of God heretofore, yea and many times continued that thoſe that go againſt their conſciences and have had Gods plea againſt them often, they have as it were felt God paſſing a ſentence of death upon them in this world and that hath ſunk them into deſpair; it hath been a particular day of judgment unto them, they have heard as it were God ſpeaking from his Throne this ſentence upon them, thou art a dead man, a loſt man.

Now ſaith God, <hi>You have been a ſnare on Miſpah and a net upon Tabor,</hi> that is thus; <hi>Miſpah</hi> and <hi>Tabor</hi> are two moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains where there is much hunting for fowl and beaſts, and the truth is, you watchmen and other people that joyn with you, have been huntſmen that have laid ſnares for the ſouls of my people as they lay ſnares on <hi>Miſpah</hi> and <hi>Tabor;</hi> becauſe they were eminent places for hunting, therefore God chargeth them for laying ſnares for the ſouls of his people, and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them and catching them in their waies of ſuperſtition and Idolatry. The Goſpel is called a Net in the Scripture, and the Miniſters of the Goſpel are to ſpread it, but the cords and twiſts of that net are precious, they are the bleſſed truths of the Goſpel, the myſteries of the Goſpel, and happy are thoſe that are caught in that net: But the net of ſuperſtitious Prieſts and Governors it is made of other manner of ſtuff, they have their ness too that they ſpread and catch the ſouls of the people in.

Thus many have been caught as a bird in a ſnare, with theſe lines and twigs thus cunningly twiſted together how have they caught ſouls?<note place="margin">ſimile</note> and ſo caught them that they could not tell how to get out, but being once in they were enſnared more and more; as a bird that is once caught in the net it beginneth to flutter a while but at length it is caught ſo much the faſter; ſo men when they yeilded to one thing they could not tell where to ſtay but at laſt they have been ſo deep in and ſo far enſnared that they could not tell what to do; and the truth is, at length they have even given up their conſciences to thoſe things; as a bird that perhaps at firſt when the net is but ſtirred it is ſhie of it, but being once got in it is enſnared all over, ſo many men at firſt, being of tender conſciences, have been ſhie of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious vanities, but with cunning arguments and devices they have been caught, and they thought they ſhould never hear of them any more, but being once caught ſo as that they have power over them, they have come upon them with more violence than before, and ſo have been made to yeild ſo far that at the laſt their conſciences have wholly been given up to thoſe things; They have been vexed and troubled with their conſciences at the firſt, but at length they have been reſolved to trouble themſelves no more but to yeild to whatſoever ſhall be enjoyned. Oh how many have been thus enſnared! This was the plot of the adverſary, if poſſibly they could they would break the conſciences of men. Oh it was the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villiſh
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:117708:137"/> plot that ever was in the world that was lately among us. When they were together in their Taverns, or jocundly ſitting together, then they were plotting &amp; ſtudying what it was that ſuch and ſuch men did ſcruple moſt at, and oh ſaies one, this, no ſaies another not this but this will catch ſuch a one; Let him have it ſaid they. It may be the old ceremonies <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> would catch ſome; others perhaps would break through the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> old, therefore there muſt be new ones deviſed; others again <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> it may be would break through the new ones, Oh but the book of liberty on the Sabbath, that would catch them; and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> if they break that through, then the Oath of cannonical obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that would catch them. Thus they laid nets to break the conſciences of men, and they knew that if they could but once break their conſciences they might do with them what they would; certainly they ſaw that there was no way to make them to be their own, to be <hi>filij Eccleſiae</hi> as they call'd them, but to crack their conſciences at firſt. Many men have found this to be true by experience, and we have ſeen it: For otherwiſe what is the reaſon when they have come with all the flatteries they could to ſome (that have ſtood out many yeers and perhaps God hath done good by their Miniſtry) to draw them but to any thing, and when they have but once prevail'd (they imagined that there was ſo much the more in it againſt their conſciences, they ſaw men look pale and trembled and were loth to yeild, but) when they had got them once, they concluded that certainly they did that which was againſt their conſciences, and now ſaid they, we have got them, and then they would heap all their injunctions upon them one after another until they had broken their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces all to ſhivers.<note place="margin">ſimile</note> And as it is with ſome birds and beaſts that when they are caught they are preſently fatted up, ſo it was with ſome Miniſters and others, when they were once got in their nets, preſently they had livings and preferment and ſome got to be Biſhops Chaplains and the like; And as ſome other birds when they are caught they are preſently nipped in the head or their limbs are broken: ſo when they had caught ſome others, they would deal ruggedly, ſeverely, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liciouſly
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:117708:138"/> with them, and would never leave until they had broke them all to pieces. Theſe were our men that have been a ſnare upon <hi>Miſpah</hi> and a net ſpread upon <hi>Tabor;</hi> But bleſſed be God that their ſnare is broken and our ſouls are eſcaped as a bird out of the hands of the fowler,<note place="margin">Note</note>

But God looked from Heaven and pittied the ſouls of his people and heard their groans and ſighs.

There were a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of preciſe people that would not be contented with that worſhip that was ſet up by authority, but they muſt have o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner of worſhip and they muſt now and then be ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:117708:138"/> to Jeruſalem at the times appointed: Now the Prieſts they counſelled thoſe that were in authority, ſay they, we ſhall never be quiet till we catch theſe men, they muſt be going to Jeruſalem, therefore let there be ſome device to apprehend them: then comes another and ſaith, moſt of them when they go they go by <hi>Miſpah</hi> and <hi>Tabor,</hi> and there are two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient places, if you will ſet ſome watch-towers there and place men in them they may take every one of them. Now this counſel pleaſed the Princes very well, and upon it (as I find in <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Arias mon.</note> who cites it out of the Jews hiſtories) there were two Towers ſet upon theſe mountains and were intended to this very purpoſe. This God chargeth them withal, and judgment is againſt you for this. Oh you ſet ſnares upon <hi>Miſpah:</hi> They were convenient places for ſuch a buſineſs, and ſo they did catch poor people that ſought to worſhip God in his own way. Oh this is that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes God exceedingly and will bring fearful judgment upon a people when Magiſtrates and Miniſters will ſeek to catch poor ſouls that would worſhip God in his own right way.

<pb n="374" facs="tcp:117708:149"/> ſecondly, particular perſons and communicants come to be defiled in this if they neglect the duty that belongs unto them as Chriſtians.

So that though the communion be defiled, that is, defiled to thoſe that are guilty, to thoſe that have neglected their duty (whereſoever the power lies in a Church, whoſoever in that Church neglects their duty of caſting out thoſe that offend, they defile the communion ſo farr as in them lieth, and if any of you that are particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers neglect your duties, ſo far as in you lieth the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is defiled by you:) but if you do your duty once, then, though wicked men may be there, you may receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with comfort; For though the communion may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed in reſpect of others that have neglected their duty, yet it is not defiled in reſpect of you that have done your duty.

The right knowledg of God will put the heart upon ſeeking after the right manner of the worſhip of God: but when men know not God, ſee not God in his glory and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and excellency, they think to put off God with any kind of worſhip.

But we have enough in Scripture for Gods own day, the Lords day, and it is appointed by God himſelf to be a day of thankſgiving for the birth, reſurrection, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion of Chriſt, and for the whol work of our redemption altogether; But man, he out of his pride will have another day and ſo ſet his poſt by Gods poſt; he thinks it is not honor enough unto Chriſt to put the celebration of his birth, death, reſurrection, aſcenſion, all together in one day; no, he thinks it is more for the honor of Chriſt to have ſeveral daies, one for his birth, another for his reſurrection, &amp; another for his aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; whereas God hath put all into one, and would have his Son to be honored by the obſervation of that one day.</p>

No ſin diſgraceth men more than pride, and that is the curſe of God upon this ſin; pride ſeeks for the greateſt honor to a man, and there is nothing that doth more diſhonor him; Why? becauſe pride doth teſtifie that there is a woful deal of evil in that mans heart. As I will inſtance a little.</p>
                  <p>A man that differs in judgment from his brethren in divers things; he differeth and he pretendeth this, he cannot ſee the
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:117708:159"/> truth of God which he would fain ſee; he cannot do as his brother for his conſcience bindeth him otherwiſe.<note place="margin">How to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern differing from others out of pride or conſcience</note> But you will ſay, every man pleads conſcience, how ſhall we know whether it be the ſtoutneſs of his heart or the tenderneſs of his conſcience? Thus, If this man behaveth himſelf humbly, and the rather humbly in all other things becauſe he cannot ſee what his brother doth in ſuch and ſuch particulars, and ſo is in danger to be an offence to his brother, and therefore his ſoul is humbled: This is a good witneſs that it is meer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and not ſtoutneſs that makes him differ. But now if his behavior be high and proud when he differeth from his brother, he doth not take it to be an affliction to him that he cannot ſee what his brother<note n="*" place="margin">or that his brother doth not ſee what he doth. This paſſage muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, 1 Of leſſer diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences. 2. Not abſolutely nor alwaies, but in things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in one is not cleer; for if he be, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but think it is at leaſt weakneſs in that particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar (though in others hee may judg him ſtronger than himſelf) that he doth not ſee the ſame with him.</note> doth, but cenſureth him and thinks that it is either through his weakneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus his pride teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to his face the inward wickedneſs of his heart.</p>
                  <p>And as in a Church, this is a principle and maxim, That though a man be guilty of many and great ſins, yet he is not to be caſt out but upon obſtinacy. You will ſay how ſhall we know that, for obſtinacy is in a mans heart? I know many obſerve ſuch and ſuch rules for it, as, if you do not reform when ſuch and ſuch learned men tell you what they would do &amp;c. But we have another rule; if after an offence and admonition there be a proud behaviour of any one in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, if he carries himſelf proudly; this his proud be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior witneſſeth to his face that it is not out of tenderneſs or ſcruple of conſcience that he yeildeth nor to what his brethren would have him, but through the ſtoutneſs of his heart. His pride teſtifieth to his face.</p>
                  <p>O the pride of mens hearts witneſſeth much againſt them. I remember I have read in <hi>Beda</hi> a ſtory of a Synod, an Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Divines that were in <hi>England,</hi>

<pb n="402" facs="tcp:117708:163"/> the hands of His enemies. God had but one Son that never ſinned againſt Him; but He hath not one Son that never was afflicted by Him. And therefore we have no cauſe to wonder that the godly ſometimes ſuffer, for His own Sonne did.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">2. None preſume on former ſervices.</note>Secondly, God would have us take into deep conſideration this meditation, That none muſt bear themſelves upon any former ſervices they do for God. When Iſrael forſook God, Judah did cleave unto Gods true worſhip, and in that God was much honored: But Judah muſt not bear himſelf upon that, Oh I have done ſervice for God, when others did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake Him I did cleave unto Him; and ſo think to take more liberty afterward: No ſaith God, though Judah hath much honored Me and cleave to My worſhip when Iſrael the ten Tribes forſook Me, yet if Judah ſhall afterwards comply with Iſrael, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Uſe </seg>
                     </label> Judah ſhall likewiſe fall. None muſt bear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon former ſervices. It is uſual with men that if they have been uſeful in ſome things; they begin to preſume, and to beheady and take liberty to themſelves to do what is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient; thinking that becauſe they have done ſome ſervice, they muſt not now be contradicted in any thing they do. Thus we find it many times among men; and upon this bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs many amongſt us have fallen. How many have there been that in the beginning of this Parliament and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of theſe Wars,<note place="margin">Servants to the Publick</note> have done good ſervice for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; and afterwards begin to be high, and malipert and proud, and they muſt have what they will and none muſt contradict them but every body muſt ſubmit unto them; and ſo through their pride though they have done good ſervice yet afterward they fall? Let every one take heed of this both in regard of God and alſo in regrd of man: you that have been moſt forward in the publick Cauſe, never think to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume becauſe of what you have done, but walk humbly now, and be ſerviceable ſtill,<note place="margin">3 God not enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to <hi>any</hi> if they tranſgreſs</note> for otherwiſe you may fall notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding your ſervices as Judah did.</p>
                  <p>Again, Another thing that God would have us take into conſideration is, That he tieth himſelf unto no people, if they
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:117708:163"/> offend, be they what they will be, God can be without them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Judah alſo ſhall fall:</hi> By that God declareth that there is no men though never ſo uſeful but he can be without them. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you may think, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> if you deſert the Cauſe where will there be any to ſtand up in your room? Take heed, though you may think you are the moſt uſeful man either in the Miniſtry, or in the City, know that God can be without you, and you may fall as well as other men.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, God would have us take notice of this,<note place="margin">4 Admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition to the <hi>wicked</hi>
                     </note> That if His own people fall with the wicked, what then may wicked men expect? If ſuch things be done to the green trees, what ſhal be don to the dry? <hi>If judgment begin at the houſe of God, where ſhall the wicked and ungodly appear?</hi> It follows.</p>

                  <p>They often change their duties, but they do not change their hearts. Many think, Well, I have done thus and thus, yea but if I ſhal ad to what I have done and do thus and thus,

                  <p>When in our ſacrifices (that are typified by thoſe legal ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices) in our prayers, there we ſeem to tender up unto God our parts, our abilities, our inventions, our expreſſions, our wits, our memories, and the ſtrength of our bodies: But now when we have done all, ſaith God, All theſe parts and all that is come from you all this while in your prayers, I do not own them, theſe are none of mine, they are al your own. This is a ſad thing.</p>
                  <p>There is no ſuch way to put an excellency upon any thing we have, upon our parts, and abilities, and eſtates, as this, To tender them up firſt unto God, and if God ſhall pleaſe to own them, then to receive them again out of Gods hands; we ſhall

But Secondly, There is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond right that God ſeemeth more to rejoyce in, and that is this, When His ſervants by an exerciſe of grace, ſhall tender them up again and give them back again unto Him; Now ſaith God, they are mine by a ſecond right; and this ſecond right unto them, they being tendered up unto me in a holy way, is the right that I rejoyce in: and this will be moſt comfortable unto you. Oh my brethren, let us not deprive God of this ſecond right to all we have or are or can do; for this will not at all weaken our right of our own to what we have, we may enjoy our eſtates and parts and abilities; but this will ſtrengthen, and ſweeten, and bleſs them abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>

                     </label> God withdraweth himſelf ſometimes from his Saints, but his withdrawing himſelf from them is not like unto his withdrawing himſelf from the wicked. As</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Though God withdraw himſelf from the Saints, yet <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> they retain good thoughts of him in his abſence; whereas the wicked pine, and vex, and fret againſt him.<note place="margin">ſimile a wife.</note> A husband may be gone abroad about his buſineſs from his wife a great while; yea but if ſhe be a faithful wife, ſhe ſtill retains good thoughts of him as of her husband and loveth him ſtill.

So wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men do upon Gods withdrawing of himſelf, in judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and afflictions, they begin to have hard thoughts of God, and to ſay, I this is to ſerve God &amp; to walk in his waies, what good have we got by all that we have done? But now you ſhall obſerve in the <hi>Cant.</hi> when Chriſt had withdrawn himſelf from the Church, ſhe ſtill calls him <hi>her King,</hi> and <hi>her Beloved,</hi> ſtill gives him honorable titles.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Though God withdraweth himſelf from his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> people, yet ſo, as he draweth their hearts after him to cry more earneſtly. As a mother wil withdraw her ſelf from her child, ſhe gets behind the door and hides her ſelf, but to this end, that the child may be more earneſt to come into her
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:117708:170"/> arms, that the child may cry after her to come to her, and the mother loves it. So the Lord loveth to hear his children cry after him to come to him. The Lord ſhall hear none of our cries in Heaven, for there we ſhall alwaies be with him; but here he ſomtimes withdraweth from us that he may hear us cry after him.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, God though he withdraw Himſelf from His Saints, yet ſo as He leaveth ſome light behind Him that they may ſee which way he is gone and ſo follow him. As when a Torch or Candle is taken out of a room, yet you may ſee ſome glimmering light which way they went; ſo when God withdraweth Himſelf He uſeth to leave ſome glimering light that his people may ſee which way to follow him.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, God withdraweth Himſelf from His People, yet ſo as his bowels yern toward them. <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. <hi>Is</hi> Ephraim <hi>my dear ſon, &amp;c.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, When God is withdrawn from the Saints, nothing will ſatisfie them till God come again. When God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draws Himſelf from others, they will ſeek after vanities to make up the want of Gods preſence; As an Adultreſs in her husbands abſence will ſeek other loves. But the Saints ſay, if God be gone I will enjoy nothing elſe, at leaſt I will be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied in nothing elſe until I have Gods preſence again.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, Though God withdraw himſelf from the Saints, yet he doth not utterly forſake them, as <hi>David</hi> praies, <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 119.8. <hi>I will keep thy precepts, O forſake me not utterly.</hi> It ſeems that then God had ſomewhat withdrawn himſelf from Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, yet mark, his heart was toward God, <hi>I will keep thy precepts,</hi> thou haſt forſaken me in ſome degree, yet I wil keep thy precepts ſtill, O forſake me not utterly. If thou canſt ſay thus, Indeed God hath withdrawn himſelf from my ſoul, yet though I have not that comfort in him that my ſoul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, I will keep his precepts as long as I live, I will do what I can to honor him: Thou mayeſt pray with comfort, Lord do not utterly forſake me.</p>
                  <pb n="417" facs="tcp:117708:170"/>
                  <p>As thoſe that are godly may depart from God,<note place="margin">Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God.</note> but yet as in <hi>Pſalm,</hi> 18.21. <hi>I have not wickedly departed from my God;</hi> they do not depart from God as other men do. So God may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the godly, but yet not ſo as he departs from the wicked.</p>
                  <p>Let us take heed of withdrawing from God,<note place="margin">Admonit.</note> of withdra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing our ſouls from any way of truth. If we in proſperity withdraw from God, and think we can live without him, he will make us know in adverſity that he can be bleſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us too. It is uſual for men in proſperity to rub out with God wel enough, but when thou comeſt into adverſity, the Lord wil make thee know, though thou periſheſt as droſs and dung from the earth, yet he will remain a bleſſed God with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thee to all eternity.

                  <p>Take we heed of this evil of dealing treacherouſly with God, not only in regard of the particular Covenants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and our own ſouls; but in a more ſpecial man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, let us take heed of breaking our publick Covenants. <hi>England</hi> hath been guilty of great ſins againſt God, but <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> was never ſo engaged unto God as it hath been of late; We never entred into ſuch ſolemn Covenants with God as we have done of late, therefore if we keep not our Covenants with God now, <hi>Englands ſins</hi> will prove to be greater than

Certainly God ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects much from us after ſuch a Covenant as we have lately entred into, the moſt ſolemn Covenant one of them that ever was taken; for people to come and lift up their hands to the moſt high God as they have done; And a <hi>National Covenant,</hi> and therefore more to be regarded than a private: yea an u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting Covenant, that uniteth two Nations if not three toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; And a Covenant that is more for the Kingdom of Chriſt, and more <hi>directly</hi> againſt the Kingdom of Antichriſt, againſt the <hi>Antichriſtian party</hi> than ever yet was taken ſince the world began.

And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though perhaps many of theſe gracious young ones may pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, yea many have been ſlain already in this Cauſe, yet let not others that remain behind be diſcouraged at it, for it is in argument that there is ſome great and ſpecial mercy that God intendeth for us, in that He is willing to venture ſuch precious ones for the procuring of that mercy. We may well reaſon ſo, that if ſo much precious young blood that might have lived to ſerve God, be ſhed in this Cauſe, if God come to grant unto <hi>England</hi> mercy, He wil grant ſuch mercy as wil be worth al their blood; and that mercy muſt needs be great
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:117708:177"/> that ſhal be worth all the blood of thoſe that are ſo precious, which might have lived to ſerve God ſo many years here in this world.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing God makes uſe of them, it is becauſe the mercy that is to come for the next generation is ſo precious, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſuch as have defiled themſelves with ſuperſtitious vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are like to have no ſhare in it; and as they are not like to live to ſee it, ſo God will not make uſe of them to prepare that mercy for the next generation: But becauſe God hath a love unto the young generation that are godly, therefore He hath reſerved much mercy for many of them that are like to ſee and enjoy it; and others of them that are not like to ſee it, yet he will be ſo gracious to them as he will imploy them in making way for that mercy: And whether it is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be made inſtrumental for the glory of God and the good of another generation, or to live to ſee the fruit of this, it is hard to determine. Certainly thoſe that in one generation are made ſo inſtrumental, as to lay the ground work of mercy for another generation, they are as happy as that other gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that comes to reap the fruit of their labours and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings; and thoſe that do come to reap the fruit of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors ſhall bleſs God for them, and when they enioy the good and liberty of the Goſpel, they ſhall ſay, Oh bleſſed be God that ſtirred up ſuch a generation of young ones to ſhed their blood, and now we reap the fruit of it, and bleſſed be God for them; they will bleſs you to all generations. Therefore let there be no diſcouragement to godly young ones though it pleaſeth God to cut of many by death in this Cauſe, for God hath ſome excellent end in it beyond all our reaches. Thus much for theſe words; Only one Note more, and that is this, That

                  <p>This Note is as full in the words as any other. God takes it exceeding ill, it is a part of treachery againſt God for any to be a means to corrupt young ones. Take heed what you do in corrupting of young ones. Thoſe young people that
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:117708:177"/> are coming on and beginning to enquire after godlineſs, take heed what you do, that you hinder them not; Eſpecially parents and governors; Oh let your conſciences flie in your faces when you begin to curb them for their forwardneſs: Many times your conſciences cannot but miſgive you when you think, I have been wicked and naught moſt part of my daies, I ſpent God knows many of my yeers in vanity and profaneſs, here are young ones that begin betime to enquire after God, and yet wretch that I am my heart riſeth againſt them.</p>
                  <p>And as theſe people that hinder young ones are to be rebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ſo ſuch as ſeek to corrupt them by falſe opinions. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is that by which God is much provoked at this day; and as on the one ſide there is hope of mercy in regard ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny young ones begin to enquire after God, ſo I know no ſuch dreadful argument of Gods diſpleaſure againſt this Nation as this, That aſſoon as young ones begin to come to know Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, there are preſently corrupt erro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Certainly the Lord hath a quarrel againſt ſuch as corrupt young ones by their falſe principles: for there are none ſo ready to drink in falſe principles as young ones, eſpecially young converts, who begin to enquire after the waies of God: and theſe men that are their corrupters, they have this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, they come not to them to perſwade them to profaneſs, but they come to them with ſeeming pretences of giving ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor unto Chriſt and of magnifying free grace, and in the mean time ſow ſeeds in them that will eat out the power of godlineſs. Oh to corrupt children and young ones and when they begin to enquire after God and to know him, for you to do that which may eſtrange them from God, this is that which God will have a quarrel againſt you for!

                  <p>But there is certainly ſomewhat elſe in this expreſſion.

                  <p>Firſt, It ſeems to have ſome reference to the way of the Jews in thoſe times, they were wont to have their daies of rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koning with their workmen and with their debters, uſually at the beginning or ending of every month, and this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſeems to allude that way of theirs; <hi>A month ſhall devour them,</hi> that is, the time of their month ſhall come when I will reckon with them, and when that fixed time ſhall come of my reckoning, they ſhall be undone, they ſhall be devoured and deſtroyed.</p>

                  <p>THE Prophet ſeeing how little impreſſion his words of threatning made in the hearts of this people:<note place="margin">Conexio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> O theſe are but words of wind, that we ſhould be devoured &amp;c. therfore in the Name of the Lord, he putteth upon himſelf another perſon. He ſpeakes now in this verſe rather as a Captain, as a General of the field, calling an Allarm preſently as if the enemy were now come to the gates; <hi>Blow ye the Cornet in</hi> Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mah, <hi>and the Trumpet in</hi> Gibeah: as if he ſhould ſay, you have often heard that the Lord would bring the ſword upon you, now it is come, it is come, the enemy is even ready to break into your Cities, to riflle your houſes, to raviſh your wives, to murder your children, <hi>Blow ye the Cornet in</hi> Gibeah, <hi>and the Trumpet in</hi> Ramah, <hi>and howl ye and cry out, O ye of</hi> Beth-aven; <hi>after thee, O</hi> Benjamin. It is a ſummoning of them, as if one ſhould come to the City and cry, The enemy, the enemy is come to the gates, Arm, Arm: So the Prophet here, that he might ſtrike into the hearts of thoſe that are ſtupid and ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſaith he, I have often in the Name of God threatned His wrath, that He will bring the ſword upon you, I ſee you are a ſtupid and ſenceleſs people; Know, that the Lord is upon you in wrath, the enemy is come, now is the time come of your deſtruction; Blow ye the Trumpet and reſiſt it as well as you can, ſet your ſelves in battel aray as well as you can,
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:117708:180"/> for now wrath and miſery is upon you. That generally is the ſcope of the words.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">Expoſ. partic.</note>But yet there are Three things to be conſidered for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opening of theſe words. (The Cornet and the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, thoſe you know were inſtruments of war, the one was made of horn, the other of braſs.) But why in <hi>Ramah</hi> and in <hi>Gibeah?</hi> that's the firſt thing: And then, why <hi>Cry aloud at Beth-aven?</hi> And thirdly, what is the meaning of that, <hi>after thee, O</hi> Benjamin?</p>

                  <p>It is fit that it ſhould be made known to them. Not only that they ſhould go to the Governors and thoſe that are in high places of authority, but go where they may make kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen the danger to all the people of the Land. It is true, in the firſt place it is fit the Governors ſhould be awakened, but if they be awakened and not the people it will prove to little purpoſe. It is that which many men of vile ſpirits of late could not endure, that Miniſters ſhould tell people of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, or tell them of the fore-runners of Gods diſpleaſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Nation; to preach ſuch things in publick Auditories, this their ſpirits mightily roſe againſt: But it is the way of God, in times of publick dangers to have the people made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted.</p>

                     <pb n="437" facs="tcp:117708:180"/> Indeed they were in the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> but <hi>Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Judah</hi> were joined in one Kingdom under the houſe of <hi>David,</hi> and the other ten Tribes were rent away under <hi>Jeroboam.</hi> Now theſe two Cities (I ſay) were in the Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Cities, and it is likely they were fortified Cities, and two of the ſtrongeſt Cities in the Kingdom. Now God is here threatning of judgment againſt <hi>Judah</hi> as He did before when He ſaid, <hi>Judah alſo ſhall fall with them.</hi> Therefore ſaith he, <hi>Blow ye the Cornet in</hi> Ramah, <hi>and the Trumpet in</hi> Gibeah, in the eminenteſt places of <hi>Judah,</hi> in the moſt fortified, and let us ſee how they are able to reſiſt the miſerie that is coming upon them.</p>
                  <p>And further, I find this to be the tranſlation of the <hi>Chaldee</hi> paraphraſe, that they would import as if the meaning were becauſe that <hi>Gibeah</hi> was the Citie of <hi>Saul;</hi> and <hi>Ramah</hi> was the Citie of <hi>Samuel,</hi> therefore that God did threaten judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their making of a King againſt his mind, and for their diſobedience to the words of <hi>Samuel.</hi> So they pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paraphraſe the text. But I think that to be ſomewhat too far fetched. The other two I conceive are the mind of the holie Ghoſt here, in the high places of the Countrie, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially in thoſe eminent Cities that were the moſt fortified, that though they were in the Tribe of <hi>Benjamin,</hi> yet belonged to the Kindom of <hi>Judah.</hi>

                  <p>Now for the Notes of obſervation from them. The firſt is this,
<q> 
                        <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſer. </seg>1</label> When danger is apprehended as preſent and real, then it takes the heart moſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Lord had threatned the ſword many times by the Prophet, and their hearts were ſecure, ſtupid; but now he comes and preſents it as preſent and real unto them, <hi>Blow ye the trumpet,</hi> the danger is now at hand, here it is ſaith the Prophet. There is a great deal of difference between mens hearing of wars and rumors of wars, and the very reallity of the evil it ſelf when that cometh before their eyes. This judgment of war,<note place="margin" type="runSum">Uſe to England.</note> of the ſword, it hath been threatned againſt this Nation long ago. I dare appeal to you, for a matter of twenty yeers ſince (you that remember the way &amp; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſtrain,<note place="margin">godly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters preaching</note> almoſt of all the godly Miniſters in the Kindom) was not their uſual theam about ſuch an argument as this, to ſhew what were the forerunners of Gods judgments againſt a Nation?<note place="margin">Miniſters duty to ſearch what ſins bring publick judgment</note> Ever ſince I was a youth and took any notice of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, I know no argument that kept the ſound in mine ears more than that: Uſually it was the theam almoſt of all the places in the Kingdom, of all your eminent Miniſters to ſearch into Gods word to ſee what were the ſins that brought publick judgments upon a Nation and apply them unto <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi>
                     <pb n="439" facs="tcp:117708:181"/> what were the forerunners of deſtruction upon a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and apply them unto <hi>England:</hi> But this was ordinarily ſlighted. Some indeed of our brethren that feared the Lord and feared his judgments, and thought that they did foreſee a ſtorm, upon that they withdrew themſelves, and they were ſcorned and contemned for their labors. But now we ſee the thing that was feared and threatned is come, it is upon many Countries: &amp; do we not apprehend it after another manner than we did when we only heard of it? In thoſe Countries where the ſword hath been raging, do not they apprehend the evil of war in another manner than ever they did when they heard it threatned in Sermons? O when it is come indeed and made real it works after another manner than it doth when it is ſpoken of.<note place="margin">Warre.</note> Thoſe men that continually have their ears fil'd with the noiſe of the Drum and Trumpet, with the neighing of Horſes and roaring of the Cannon, they will tell you that war is a dreadful thing indeed. So it is in all other afflictions that are threatned; how little are they regarded in their threats? but when they come indeed, Oh then how do the hearts of men ſink within them! Oh now God is coming againſt me, now wrath is upon me ſaith the guilty ſoul, how far it may go out I know not; I heard often of ſuch and ſuch things, now it is come, it is come. Oh the dreadful appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions that are in mens hearts of the wrath of God when it is come! whereas before when it is threatned it is never feared.<note place="margin">Obſ. The leſſe a <hi>threatning</hi> is heard, the more the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is felt when upon us.</note>
                  </p>
                  <q>And this is a rule, an everlaſting rule, That the leſſe a judgment is feared when it is threatned, the more dreadfull apprehenſions there are of it in the heart when once it cometh to be executed. That's the firſt Note.</q>
                  <p>The ſecond is this,
<q>The Miniſters of God they muſt make the things they are <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſer. </seg>2</label> to preach to the people as real before their eyes as poſſibly they can.<note place="margin">Sermons muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to the life what they preſſe.</note>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They ſhould ſtudy all waies and means they can to make what they preach to the people to be real to them, not to be as notions to them. So the Prophet here, he had preached
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:117708:182"/> often times of the judgments of God, of the Sword, but this would not do it, therefore now he ſtrives to make what he had delivered to appear in the moſt real way that poſſibly he could to the eyes and hearts of the people, &amp; he ſaw that to be the only way to do them good. It is not therfore enough for a Miniſter barely to tel the people truths, to tel them what danger they are in, but by all means of expreſſions that may be to make this appear in the reallity of it unto them. We know how <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was wont to do, he threatned their carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, and he went and made before them a kind of ſiege to make it real to them. So <hi>Jeremiah</hi> and other Prophets. Now though Miniſters cannot do ſo as they did, yet they are to ſtudy all manner of expreſſions that poſſibly they can to preſent things in the greateſt reallitie that may be. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this is a great part of the skill of a good Miniſter, not barely to tell truths unto people, but to be able to make things appear real to them.<note place="margin">Wherein eſpecially conſiſts the Art of preaching</note> The art of preaching I ſay lies eſpecially in this, to make things appear real to the ſouls of an Auditory. As now, when we come to tell you of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſin and of the wrath of God that is due to it; we tell you this and we quote Scripture for it, this perhaps ſtirs not the heart; but now if we can ſo preſent Gods wrath to you, to make it real before your eyes, to put you upon this, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think your ſelves in what a caſe you would be if now all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were taking their leaves of you, if now you were ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding before the great God to receive the ſentence of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,<note place="margin">More <hi>good</hi> this way in a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour than in many years o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe.</note> if God were now at this inſtant coming upon you: If I ſay we could put you to it, and ſo preach as that you ſhould apprehend theſe things as real before your eyes, this would ſtick, and more good might be done in one quarter of an hour this way, than perhaps in divers yeers before. The power of a Miniſtry conſiſteth much in this. And I ſuppoſe ſome of you know by experience what that is that now I mean by the Miniſters making things real to your hearts. Have not you found ſometimes ſome truths made ſo real to you out of the word,<note place="margin">When a Sermon works re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally.</note> to your conſciences, that you have thought that you have even ſtood before the Throne of God
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:117708:182"/> and you have thought that God was even pronouncing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt you? Some have expreſt it thus, and have ſaid, ſuch a time I went to hear the Word, and me thought there I was ſummoned before the great God unto judgment, I ſaw the Lord God Himſelf ſpeaking to me, I had repreſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mine eyes the wickedneſs of my life, my danger, the wrath of God, and even the very flaſhes of Hell fire upon my conſcience, I felt this upon me. Now God was in the Word indeed when the reality of things were preſented to my ſoul. And certainly it is the labor and endeavor of godly Miniſters in their ſtudies, not only to ſpeak an hour or two out of a text and to wear out ſo much time; but they are thinking, what way ſhall I take (&amp; ſo they pray that God would help them to take ſuch a way) to preſent ſuch and ſuch Truths in the greateſt reality to the ſouls of their Audience that poſſibly they can. This is apparent from hence, that the Prophet doth not only tell them of their danger, but ſpeaks as if it were at hand, and makes it thus real before them.</p>
                  <p>Another Obſervation is this,
<q>That though the Miniſters of God are at firſt to be the Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſer. </seg>3</label> of peace and reconciliation,<note place="margin">Miniſters after their Embaſſie of <hi>peace</hi> is ſlighted muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <hi>war.</hi>
                        </note> to preach peace between God and people; but yet if this their Miniſtry of Reconciliation do not take effect, if it prevail not; then they are to come in the Name of God to proclaim the war of God againſt a ſoul.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For they know that God muſt have honor one way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, either by peoples ſubjecting themſelves unto Him, or by Gods revenging Himſelf upon them. Honor, God muſt have: howſoever you may think the Word of God will paſs, yet thoſe that are faithful Miniſters, they know God muſt have His Honor one way or other; either willingly you muſt come in and give it unto Him, or He will force it out from you: If the joyful ſound of mercy be not received, the dreadful ſound of war muſt fill your ears.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What occaſions of war ſoever there be in a Land, the <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſer. </seg>4</label> principal cauſe is, Gods diſpleaſure againſt the ſins of that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and eſpecially the cauſe is thoſe that are ſuperſtitious and idolatrous in that Nation.</q>
                  <pb n="442" facs="tcp:117708:183"/>
                  <p>For ſo it is here, <hi>They have dealt treacherouſly, they have begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſtrange children; therefore a month ſhall devour them. Blow ye the cornet in Ramah, and the trumpet in Gibeah &amp;c.</hi> Upon this ground, becauſe of their treacherous dealing with God, and bringing up of their children in waies of Idolatry. It is true, when danger is come to a Nation, the people of the Land are ready to lay it upon thoſe that are moſt free from it. Who is it that men at this day lay the troubles of this Nation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but upon thoſe that have al this while ſtood in the gap to prevent dangers to the Nation, and that have with more pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers &amp; tears ſought God than thoſe that are ſo ready to charg them with it? But this hath been in all ages, the Saints have been made the troublers of a Nation: <hi>But is it not Thou and thy fathers houſe,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, ſpeaking even to <hi>Ahab</hi> Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? The troublers of Iſrael lie not in the Prophets, lie not in the Miniſters as men cry out, that they preach ſedition.</p>
                  <p>And it was wont indeed to be the title of <hi>Luther</hi> that great inſtrument of God, they called him the trumpet of rebellion: and not a new thing therefore is it, that the Miniſters of God that firſt preach the word of Reconciliation, and then ſeek to ſhew people their danger, no marvel they be accounted the cauſers of their troubles, becauſe they will not let people go on quietly in their waies, but in the Name of God oppoſe, and <hi>reprove</hi> them. But we know where our trouble lies, it lies in thoſe that are moſt ſuperſtitious and idolatrous, they bring the ſword: Do not attribute it to this and the other cauſe, it is the provocation of the moſt high God that brought theſe wars in upon us,: If therefore we be weary of war, let us be weary of our ſins. I remember <hi>Polanus</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Polanus.</note> upon this text hath this Note, and indeed he hinted it unto me; ſaith he, The Jeſuits they cry out of the Goſpel in <hi>Hungary;</hi> a place which is near the Turks, and the Turks you know have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made incurſions upon thoſe Countries, and your Papiſts and Jeſuits they cried out of your <hi>Evangelici,</hi> of your Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, as if they were the cauſe of the Turks coming in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them. But the Lord knows where to lay the burden right.</p>
                  <pb n="443" facs="tcp:117708:183"/>
                  <p>Again, in the next place, from thoſe words, [<hi>Cry aloud at Beth-aven</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Beth-aven.</note>] According to that interpretation I gave you, it was the place where one of the Idols were ſet, and a moſt ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious and Idolatrous place. Now mark the difference, it is but only blow the Cornet and Trumpet in <hi>Ramah</hi> and in <hi>Gibeah;</hi> but it is <hi>cry aloud,</hi> or ſhrike out, and howl, Oh <hi>Beth-aven.</hi> From thence theſe two Notes.</p>
                  <q>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That ſuperſtitious places in the time of Gods judgment <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Obſer. </seg>1</label> are in the greateſt diſtreſs of all: <hi>and ſo ſuperſtitious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>When Gods hand cometh out againſt a Nation, it will fall heavieſt upon thoſe that are Idolatrous and ſuperſtitious. It is true, Gods hand hath hitherto fallen heavie and very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy upon many of our brethren, upon Gods dear Saints; but hath it not fallen heavily upon Idolaters and ſuperſtitious ones? How ever, mark the end, ſtay till God hath done, and you will find that the hand of God will be heavieſt upon them; <hi>Howl O Beth-aven.</hi> Thoſe places that have been the neſts of ſuperſtition and Idolatry, thoſe are the places that His wrath wil be moſt againſt. And indeed they do begin to howl and cry out already: For though ſome of Gods people have felt hard things, yet, Have two Nations lifted up their hands to the moſt high God to extirpate Gods people?

                  <p>Inſtead of repairing unto God by faith and repentance, all that they have to do is to cry out and to howl. <hi>Howl O Beth-aven;</hi> they were far enough from coming to humble their ſouls to the Lord, and in a gracious manner to accept of the puniſhment of their iniquity; and to bear the affliction that God laies upon them; Oh no, but their ſpirits were vexed and enraged, they could howl and cry out, and that is all.<note place="margin">Applic.</note> Is not this the way of many that heretofore, Oh how diligent
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:117708:184"/> were they in their prayers and worſhiping of God, yet when they come into affliction what do they? but vex and rage, howl and cry out; but far are they from giving glory unto God according to that way he requireth; they howl upon their beds ſaith God, but they did not ſeek unto me. And God threatneth this in <hi>Amos,</hi> 3.10.<note place="margin">Amos 3.10 opened,</note> (and that Prophet was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary with <hi>Hoſea) I will turn the ſongs of their Temples into howlings:</hi> They had their ſinging ſervice before, ſaith God, I will turn thoſe into howlings, for it is no other, their cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out under affliction and trouble, it is no other before God but as howling. The Lord accepteth in another manner of the cryings of His people under oppreſſion; they cry unto God and ſend up their prayers of faith, and the incenſe of a broken heart, and God accepteth of the ſighs, and of the moans that they make unto Him, and they do prevail excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly with the Heart of God. But for the crying out of wicked and ungodly men under Gods hand, He regards it not, no more than howling.

<pb n="446" facs="tcp:117708:185"/> yet becauſe we find that the heat of the wars are it may be twenty, thirty, or fourty miles from us, how ſecure are we, as if God did not intend us at all, as if we had nothing to do to take notice of Gods hand upon our brethren. Wrath is purſuing, but becauſe it is not upon us, Oh the ſecurity and deſperate folly that is amongſt us in the mean time! Juſt ſo it was in <hi>Germany</hi> as travellers obſerved, that if the wars were but a Town or a few miles from them, they went on in their trading as quietly and ſecurely as ever till at length it came upon them and devoured them. Hath it not been ſo in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places in <hi>England?</hi> May it not be ſaid of many places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, as here in the text, <hi>Ramah,</hi> and <hi>Gibeah,</hi> and <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aven,</hi> after thee, <hi>O Benjamjn?</hi> So may we not name ſeveral Towns, <hi>Banbury</hi> and <hi>Worceſter,</hi> after thee, <hi>O Exceter, O Briſtol?</hi> It may be thoſe in <hi>Briſtol</hi> and in <hi>Exceter</hi> when the wars were in <hi>Shropſhire</hi> and <hi>Coventry</hi> and other parts, they thought they were free, and they were ſafe enough: And truly though God hath delivered us all this while, yet if we be ſecure, it may be as well ſaid of us, <hi>Exceter</hi> and <hi>Briſtol,</hi> and after thee, <hi>O London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But you will ſay, <hi>What ſhall we do upon this, when the hand of God is ſtretched out thus neer us?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Humble our ſouls before God,</hi> go forth to meet this mighty God with repentance, cry mightily unto him that if it be poſſible His wrath may be appeaſed before it faſten upon us. As in that <hi>Luke</hi> 14.32.<note place="margin">Luke, 14.32.</note> it is ſaid of thoſe that are wiſe, when a great King cometh out againſt them with twenty thouſand, when he was a great way off, they ſend Ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours to deſire conditions of peace.<note place="margin">opened.</note> Mark, when he is <hi>a great way off;</hi> So we muſt not ſtay till God is come to our gates, till he be juſt upon us, but while this great King, the Lord God is a great way off, at a diſtance, we muſt ſend unto Him, and meet Him by repentance and by humbling our ſouls and making of our peace with him. Let not us think 'Tis true, the hand of God was againſt our brethren of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but they were quickly delivered; but I may ſay, <hi>after thee, O England.</hi> We have not done what our brethren did;
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:117708:185"/> For it is obſerved that though the generallity of that people were notorious vile, wicked, and rude before theſe times, but yet partly through the Covenant they have entred into and otherwiſe, (though no queſtion there is much evil there, and perhaps not the power of godlineſs ſo throughly as in many of Gods people here,) but there is certainly abundance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation more in the common people than there is amongſt us at this day; which ſpeaks hard things to us: Oh let us go forth and meet our God by repentance.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>We ſhould riſe as one man, ſenſible of our brethrens miſery, and go out and help them.</hi> For this hath been our evil, that we have ſuffered the Kingdom to moulder away, our brethren to be deſtroyed; Oh ſaith one place, what need we trouble our ſelves? and ſo the Land is deſtroyed by peice-meal. Certainly it is the duty of the Kingdom and of thoſe that remain, that when they ſee their brethren though at a diſtance to ſuffer ſo much wrong, they ſhould all rile as one man to venture themſelves for the releif of their brethren, and not think themſelves ſecure becauſe it is not yet upon them.<note place="margin">Scots co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into England.</note> We ſee our brethren of <hi>Scotland</hi> do ſo, they were willing to come in with their help, and though the ſword is far from them yet no queſtion ſome of them think of this very text, now the Trumpet is blown in <hi>England,</hi> in the <hi>Northern-parts,</hi> after thee, <hi>O Scotland,</hi> they think after our turn is over, theirs is next, therefore they are willing to prevent it, though it be in ſuch a hard ſeaſon as this, to help their brethren.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>We ſhould be ſo wiſe in a way of true prudence to our ſelves, as to meet with our danger before it cometh; not ſuffering our adverſaries to make our Countrey the ſeat of their war.</hi> It is eaſier to keep an adverſary at a diſtance than to repell him when he is cloſed with us. This hath ever been the policie of wiſe men, rather to go out to meet an adverſary than to think to have ſtrength enough to repel them when they come. Thus in general.</p>
                  <p>And then, As Kingdoms, ſo particular perſons they ſhould lay to heart Gods judgments neer to them; As thus: Doſt thou ſee Gods hand upon thy neighbor, after thee, O ſinner;
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:117708:186"/> thy turn may be next: what is Gods hand ſtretched out, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your fellow-ſervant, upon your brother, upon your deer friend? after thee, O ſinner, thou art guilty of the ſame ſin, thy turn may be next: Is Gods hand out upon thy compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after thee, O ſinner. Oh lay this to heart, think with thy ſelf, my turn may come to be the next, and it may ſoon come to be my turn. The very thought of this, when God hath ſtruck ſome with ſudden death in a fearful manner, God hath ſanctified this to ſome; what (thought they) if God ſtrike me next? ſuch a one is ſent down for ought I know to his place, I may be the next: the thought (I ſay) of this hath been ſo ſetled upon the heart of ſome, that it hath been a me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In every ſtrait they were in, they conceited God hated them in it, though God had done them good ſo many times. And hath not this been the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings of our unbeleeving hearts, and the murmuring of our ſpirits in our afflictions? Oh take heed of ſuch unbeleeving reaſonings, they are very much diſpleaſing unto God: There is a great difference between the rebukes of God upon the godly, and the wicked, though perhaps rebuked both in one and the ſame affliction: as the Apothecary breaks Bezar ſtones to pouder, but is very careful of it,<note place="margin">ſimile</note> and will not loſe the leaſt grain of it. So the Lords people even in the fornace are as dear to him &amp; have the moſt experience of Gods love to them then that ever they had. <hi>Jacob</hi> when he lay upon the ground, and had the ſtone for his pillow, even then he had that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly viſion from God.</p>

                  <p>It may be known thus: If Gods diſpleaſures be ſuch, <label type="milestone">

                  <p>But you will ſay, <hi>This is as difficult as the other, How ſhall we know God aims at our ſins, and not our perſons?</hi> Thus:</p>
                  <p>If His rebukes work us to a humiliation for our ſins, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of our ſelves up unto Gods diſpoſe, and to accept of the puniſhment of our iniquities; this is an argument God

But here the difference is thus diſcerned.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, They cry out of their ſins but <hi>per accidence,</hi> but of the judgement <hi>per ſe,</hi> as we uſe to ſay, the judgement troubles them more than their ſins the cauſe of the judgment: but the godly cry out of their ſin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. The goodneſs of God is not honored by us, when the Lord for our good ſhall give us notice of our ſins that ſo we may prevent judgment the deſert of our ſins, and we notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. The truth of God is not honored, when we do not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, this is no other than a venturing whether the word be true or no, whether Gods words are yea and nay, Oh ſinner doſt thou know what thou doſt, thou tempteſt God, ſaying, <q rend="inline">Lord there are ſuch and ſuch threatnings againſt ſin but I do not beleeve them, Lord I'le venture it, I'le put it to the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all whether it be ſo or no.</q>

                  <p n="3">3.

God by His Miniſters warned me in ſuch a Sermon, but I went on and would not reform, and now there is matter for the worm of conſcience to gnaw upon: that thou maiſt ſay as <hi>Job, What I feared is now come upon me,</hi> and this is that which aggravates our miſery.<note place="margin" type="runSum">Uſe.

                  <p>

                  </p>
                  <p>As 'tis ſaid of <hi>Eſau, He found no place for repentance. Heb.</hi> 12.17.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.17.</note> There is a great miſtake by many in the interpretation of that place, from which text many gather that there may be many tears ſhed, much ſorrow found, and yet no true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, but the meaning of the words is this, he found no place for his father <hi>Iſaacs</hi> repentance, though he cried and ſhed tears for the bleſſing, yet his father repented not that he had beſtowed it upon <hi>Jacob:</hi> ſo that people may cry and humble their ſouls before God, yet ſhall find in God no place of repentance, nay if that the Saints of God ſhould all joyn together and pray for ſuch a people they ſhould not prevail; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14.20. <hi>Though</hi> Noah, Daniel, <hi>and</hi> Job <hi>ſhould pray for them, they ſhould not prevail.</hi> Oh ſinner take heed this be not thy condition, thou haſt godly parents and kindred it may be, and they ſet themſelves to ſeek God for thee, but God will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them, their prayers ſhall not prevail for thee; this may be the caſe of Nations and Kingdoms, that there may be true repentance found and turning to God, and yet no deliverance from outward affliction. I deny not but that true repentance ſhall deliver a ſoul from eternal wrath, from periſhing in hell; <hi>but this I affirm that there may be true repentance found and turning unto God and yet no deliverance from a temporal affliction.</hi> And this I ſhall make good by two famous texts of Scripture. The firſt is in <hi>Deut.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſinned, and God ſaith he ſhould not go into the land of Canaan, which was a ſore affliction to <hi>Moſes,</hi> upon this <hi>Moſes</hi> he praid, and 'tis certain <hi>Moſes</hi> had repented him of that ſin, yet ſee what he ſaith, <hi>The Lord was wrath with me, for your ſake, and would not hear me, but let it
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:117708:190"/> ſuffice thee, ſpeak no more of this matter.</hi> All his prayers and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance could not deliver him from that outward affliction, and bring him into Canaan. The ſecond text is in 2 <hi>Kings,</hi> 23.25. in the former chapter we find the heart of the King melting when he heard the Law read, and perceived the anger of the Lord againſt his people was provoked, yet the Lord tels him that he ſhould die in peace. And in the 23. Chapter, the King he ſets upon reforming the people, enters into a ſolemn Covenant with God, cauſeth the people to joyn with him, pulls down the groves, deſtroies Idolatry, and although it be ſaid in the 25. verſe, that like unto him was there no King before him, yet in the 26. verſe God ſaith, <hi>Notwithſtanding all this, he will remove Judah out of his ſight.</hi> So that ſometimes God is ſo ſet upon his threats, that they ſhall come to paſs, God will make them good whatever comes of it; this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be the meaning of theſe words. And ſo Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> reades them, God may be ſo reſolved againſt a mans eternal eſtate that he will never ſhew ſuch a man or ſuch a people mercy more; as we may ſee in thoſe which were bid to the Goſpel-ſupper: therefore we had need to gather our ſelves together before the decree bring forth, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.1, 2. Oh let us in this Kingdom take heed; yet through Gods mercy we are not left deſolate, but have many points of mercy, even in this day of our rebuke, but what God will do one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determine, therefore it concerns us to prepare to meet our God, leſt the wrath of God meet us, overcome and deſtroy us till there be no remedy, though through mercy for the preſent we may ſay there is remedy, yea rather let us tremble and be awakened, becauſe God ſometimes comes againſt, and is more quick with a people that are not ſo openly, and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly vile as others are, than he doth with the moſt profane: So much for this ninth verſe.</p>

                  <p>The Princes of Judah broke down the bounds in a Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold way.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>They took away mens eſtates that were none of their own.</hi> God appoints men their bounds and eſtates, therefore 'tis not in the power of Princes to take them away at their pleaſure. It was not in the power of <hi>Ahab</hi> to take away <hi>Naboths</hi> Vinyard, nay, nor to force him to ſell it, though a King, he thought it too much to take it by violence; and <hi>Jezebel,</hi> though a cruel
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:117708:191"/> woman, yet would not take his Vinyeard without ſome cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor of Law. Therefore Princes have no right to the Subjects eſtates, and liberty for to take them away at their pleaſures; though ſuch principles of late have been infuſed into them by ſome, for which we at this day ſuffer ſo heavily. In <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.23. Their Princes are ſaid, <hi>to be rebellious and companions of theeves.</hi> Now if all were their own they could not break bounds: We would think that they of all men ſhould not break bounds, for what is it they may not have if they would? I have read a ſtory in <hi>Plutarch,</hi> concerning <hi>Cyneas</hi> and <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> who was mightily ſet upon war with <hi>Italy, Cyneas</hi> ſpeaks thus unto him; What ſhall we get if we overcome the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans?</hi> Saith <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> We ſhall ſubdue our great enemy, and be made poſſeſſors of a brave Country. <hi>Cyneas</hi> asked him what he would do then? Saith <hi>Pyrrhus,</hi> Then we will ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due <hi>Affrica, Carthage,</hi> and <hi>Sicila:</hi> And what then? Then ſaith <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> we wil feaſt, drink and be merry. <hi>Cyneas</hi> anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, Why may you not do ſo now without ſheding ſo much blood, putting your ſelf to ſo much trouble and endange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring your perſon. If Princes would keep within their bounds what hinders but that they may enjoy themſelves and their comforts with peace and quiet without the ſheding of ſo much blood.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>They break all bounds:</hi> That is, They break all Laws and Liberties; they wil not be bound by Laws, ſaying thus, <hi>Laws were made for ſubjects, and not for Princes.</hi> And thus theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces broke the bounds. Hence we may ſee what corruption there is in the hearts of men naturally, and this is furthered by evil Counſellors. I have read of <hi>Cambyſes</hi> who had a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to marry his Siſter, but queſtioning whether he might do it or no, he cals his judges together to give him their advice, they told him, there was a Law againſt it; but ſay they, Ye Princes of <hi>Perſia</hi> may do what you will: They were ſo far from diſwading him from that wicked act, that they gave him incouragement to it. <hi>And hath not our time afforded ſuch Counſellors to our Princes?</hi>

And eſpecially of this firſt, this ſickneſs of Judah: we have a notable ſtory (for it is referred to theſe times) in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 7.1. and ſo on; There you may find the ſickneſs of Judah, and how <hi>Judah</hi> ſaw it: When <hi>Rezin</hi> King of <hi>Syria,</hi> and <hi>Pekah</hi> ſon of <hi>Remaliah</hi> came againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> the heart of the King, and the heart of his people were moved, as the trees of the wood are moved with the wind; as we uſe to ſay, they did ſhake like an Aſpen leaf, they were ſo troubled.

And there he gives two reaſons why Idolaters ſhould never be ſent for to help us in any of our ſtraights.<note place="margin">1.

<pb n="493" facs="tcp:117708:206"/> for they joyning with you, they will come ſecretly to cauſe their Idolatrous waies to have an influence into you. But ſecondly, he gives eſpecially this reaſon, if you ſend for their help ſaith he, how can you joyn together in prayer to God to bleſs you?<note place="margin">2 they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray not give thanks.</note> and when you have gotten victory how can you joyn together in praiſing God? And indeed this is as great an argument not to make uſe of the help of wicked men in publick affairs of a Kingdom as poſſibly can be, for how can they joyn together in prayer? And truly they are unfit to joyn together in fighting that cannot joyn together in prayer and in praiſing of God. And yet this is very natural to moſt men, yea good men are ſometimes guilty of this, to ſeek out too much unto wicked men for help in times of ſtraits. That was the blame that was laid upon <hi>Aſa,</hi> though otherwiſe a godly King, in the 1 <hi>King.</hi> 15.19. that he ſent to <hi>Benhadad</hi> the King of Syria to help him; And in 2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.7. <hi>Hanani</hi> the Seer told him that he ought not to have done it, and that he had done fooliſhly in doing it, for ſaith he, why will you do it, you need not ſend for ſuch help, for the eyes of the Lord run to and fro thoroughout the whol earth to ſhew himſelf ſtrong in the behalf of thoſe whoſe heart is perfect towards Him. So that it was an argument that in this thing <hi>Aſa's</hi> heart was not perfect with God, becauſe he ſought for help from wicked men ſo much as he did, and did not relye upon the Lord. And it is very obſervable of this King, though a good man, and it ſeems, a Souldier, yet he was very angry with the Seer, the text ſaith, verſe 10. that <hi>Aſa was wrath with the Seer and put him in a priſon houſe,</hi> for he was in a rage with him becauſe of this thing: what! ſhall a Prophet contradict him in his warlike affairs?

                  <p>I confeſs ſomtimes for a little while (as I ſay) there is a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle caſe.

This creature is very fierce, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Geſner</hi> in his Hiſtorie of living creatures ſaith, That na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath ſo ordered it that becauſe the Lyon is ſo fierce of himſelf, that alwaies he hath a kind of a <hi>quartan</hi> feaver or ague upon him to mittigate or refreſh his fierceneſs.

                     <note place="margin">The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the text.</note>But what is the reaſon of the difference of theſe expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here?

They were both ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:117708:209"/> but Judah retained ſomewhat of Gods true worſhip, therefore God would ſpare them a little: Though wicked men will ſpare the Saints ſo much the leſs becauſe of their godlineſs, and will take ſo much the more advantage of their frailties becauſe they are profeſſors, yet God will pitie them.</p>
                  <p>The obſervations from hence are theſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>When Gods leſſer afflictions work not,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Obſer. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>there God will be moſt terrible.</hi> You heard of the moth and little worm before; they are leſſer afflictions, and it ſeems the moth and little worm did not work their hearts to repentance, to bring them unto God, therefore God doth turn to be a fierce Lyon and a Lyons whelp unto Ephraim and Judah. Gods wrath is as <hi>Elijahs</hi> cloud that at firſt appeareth but as a handbreadth, but within a while after the whol Heavens were overſpread with it: It is as the thunder, that when you hear it firſt it is <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">ſimile </seg>1</label> but a little roaring noiſe a far off, but ſtay a while and it will be a dreadful crack. It is as the fire that at firſt burneth a little within upon a few boards, but when it prevaileth it <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">ſimile </seg>2</label> burſteth out in a moſt terrible flame. As in that known place <hi>Levit.</hi> 26.18. <hi>If you will not yet for all this</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto me, then will I puniſh you ſeven times more for your ſins;</hi> and again, <hi>ſeven times more,</hi> and <hi>ſeven times</hi> more. God will go on in His wrath from a little unto a great deal of wrath; From being as a moth and as a little worm, to be like a Lyon. Such degrees there are in Gods wrath. You had need look to it when the hand of God is ſtretched out but a little againſt you, though it be but as a moth and as a worm yet if you look not to it, there may be ſuch a gradation of Gods wrath upon you; For as great a difference as is between a moth and a fierce Lyon, ſuch a difference may be between wrath now and that which is to come. Thus the Lord is many times unto mens ſpirits: Many men have gripes and nips of conſcience,<note place="margin">Admonit. to thoſe that are a little tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched in ſpirit.</note> and God cauſeth ſecretly that worm of conſcience to be gna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing upon them, and there is ſome kind of trouble, but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they go on in their ſins; and at length God co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth upon them as a Lyon, tearing their ſpirits. Did you never ſee a ſinner lying upon his death bed in the torment of
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:117708:210"/> his ſoul, Gods wrath like the pawes of a Lyon preying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very caul of his heart,<note place="margin">A dying &amp; terrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience.</note> when he lies roaring out he is damned, he is damned! and now he ſees, yea feels the heat of the wrath of God againſt him. Thus God comes as a Lyon to prey upon thoſe that will not regard the gnawings of the worm: When the worm was but little and ſmall, they ſligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, and that cauſed God to bring the greater judgment. So it is with families; God cometh upon families ſometimes in a little ſickneſs, in a child or in a ſervant, and that is not regarded; afterwards God cometh with plague of peſtilence or ſome other dreadful judgment.</p>
                  <p>So in Kingdoms, the Lord cometh firſt with little judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and then with greater. As in <hi>Ireland,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ireland.</note> for many yeers together, there the Lord was as a moth and rottenneſs, but of late how like a Lyon hath he there appeared? How hath He torn and rent that Kingdom in a moſt dreadful man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner?</p>
                  <p>Yea the truth is the Lord had been to <hi>England</hi>
                     <note place="margin">England</note> as a moth and rottenneſs; And this very text I make no queſtion but ſome of you have heard many yeers ago applied unto <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> when as thoſe Miniſters that preached upon this text did little think that ever there ſhould be ſuch a hand of God againſt many parts of <hi>England</hi> as now there is at this day. In many parts of this Kingdom the Lord is at this day as a Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. We all hear the roaring of the Lyon, and who can but tremble! Oh it is time for us all to fall down to the ground before the Lord. It is true God hath not yet come to this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie as a Lyon to tear and rend it as other places in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie;<note place="margin">London.</note> but yet we have heard the roaring of the Lyon abroad, and God calleth us to fall down before Him that He may not be ſo to us, that he may not come and tear us likewiſe. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the Lord will have glory of His creature; God hath ſworn by Himſelf and the word hath proceeded out of His mouth in righteouſneſs, that every knee muſt bow to Him, and every tongue confeſs His Name: Every creature muſt ſubmit unto Him, and if leſſer judgments will not do it, God will lay every ſinner upon His back, He will come as a Lyon to tear him in pieces.</p>

Our ſins have had an influence into the miſeries of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; our ſins have been thoſe claws and teeth that have torn our brethren.

This is Gods glory, and yet to be free from the evil of ſin.

In ſome judgments upon men, God makes ſo much uſe of the creature, that ſinners can ſee little of Gods hand in them, but in ſome others, they can eaſily ſee the hand of God in them; <hi>Belſhazzer</hi> trembled at the hand-writing, and his thoughts were troubled within him, why ſo? the hand ſtruck him not at all, only he ſaw it to be the hand of God, the hand of the Deity was in it, <hi>Dan.</hi> 5.5, 6. and this made him to tremble. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Behold, I, even I do bring a floud:</hi> And that wrath which is out againſt us at this time, eſpecially our adverſaries, is the hand of God in a ſpecial manner, God may well ſay to us,<note place="margin">Applic.

A woman whoſe breaſts are ſore muſt be throughly tented before it be healed, and ſhe bids the Chyrurgion cure her well and thoroughly though it be long and painful: So ſaith God, this people are very ſorely wounded, but I will take them in hand and heale them, but their cure will be very long and teadious, ſore and painful. Now ſaith this people, ſeeing it is thus, Come, let us return, it matters not though our healing coſt us dear and it be painful, it is enough that God will heal us; Let our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe be never ſo grievous, Come and let us return. A man that hath a mortal wound about him, what pain will not he be willing to endure in healing ſo he may be ſure of cure? This people conceived themſelves ſo wounded that if God had not taken them to cure they muſt have periſhed, but in that God had undertaken the cure, they were confident they ſhould be healed.</p>

                  <pb n="545" facs="tcp:117708:236"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Hath God beſtowed reviving mercies upon you? then be willing to give God the glory of them, and reſign them up to him, upon thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> ground, becauſe we have forfited them by our unbeleef: an unbeleeving heart forfits all mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies before he hath them; 'tis true God gives many precious mercies to ſad, dumpiſh, froward, diſcontented ſpirits, but you cannot have that comfort in your mercies which others have becauſe they are forfited, and though God through his bounty lets you enjoy them, yet you are in fear continually leſt God ſhould take his forfiture. Oh beleeve your mercies in the promiſe through the difficulties.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Remember the Covenants which you made unto God in the times of your trouble, and keep them. 'Tis a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking ſin to break Covenant with God, God complains of it againſt Iſrael, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.38. <hi>They flattered him with t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>eadfaſt in their Covenants.</hi> Oh how uſual is it with men in any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery to Covenant largely with God, and preſently to forget what they have done! this is a ſign of a falſe heart, therefore take heed of it. Lay more wait upon your Covenants which you make, if ever you mean to give God real praiſe for any mercy.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Conſider how much better it is to give God the glory of a mercy willingly, than force him to extort it from you in a way of wrath; God is better pleaſed with active praiſe, than paſſive for his mercies; conſider, glory he will have for his mercies, Oh put not God to that trouble to force his own glory ſo due to him, from you, if you give not God the glory of a mercy in poſſeſſion, he in wrath will take it from you: and had not God given us this reviving mercy, it might have been our caſe to have been forced to give God his glory in a paſſive way.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, Whatever God c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>lls for now, from you, be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to give it up to him freely; whatſoever we would have been willing to have given for ſuch a mercy in our miſery, had God indented with us for it, let us be ready and willing to give it to him now the mercy is come; had we known our
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:117708:237"/> danger and the miſeries which would have flowed in upon us had not mercy prevented, if God ſhould have ſaid thus, What would you do? what would you ſuffer? what would you part withal for me? and you ſhall be delivered out of this danger and poſſeſs the contrary mercy? Then ſeeing God hath given us ſuch a mercy without this indenting, make this an argument to come off freely in giving God that which he now calls for; you have been (perhaps) in bodily fears and danger of death by ſome ſickneſs, now if God ſhould have cald for your eſtates, would not you have given them to him? Do that now which you would then have done.</p>

                     <pb n="547" facs="tcp:117708:237"/> found a reviving mercy preſently upon it in the 1. and 2. verſes of the 18. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> where he praiſed God for that mercy, which formerly he would not beleeve; before in this 2. verſe he ſets out God in way of praiſe by eight titles,<note place="margin">8.

Is it not with too to many of us as it was with thoſe in <hi>James,</hi> 2.15. who ſay to a brother, <hi>Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled,</hi> but give them not wherewith to do it? what good doth this paſſing cloud do them? it is but an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verture:

Now the Covenant here cannot be meant imediatly of the Covenant of works, nor of the Covenant of grace, for this Covenant here implyed, is one eſpecially made with them, and therfore muſt be underſtood of that at mount Sinai, made many hundred years after the others, yet it hath reference to that of Works, and of Grace.</p>

                  <p>THeſe words are ſomething difficult, I ſhall ſhew the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of them, thus; Judah hath wraped up her ſelf in the ſame offence, in the ſame tranſgreſſion received from E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim, (the ten Tribes) and it was grown up to an harveſt of judgment, which was ſet, had its fixed time. But when? <hi>When I returned the captivity of my people.</hi> This refers to that time in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.6. where you ſhall find theſe three things: 1. The harveſt ſet for Judah. 2. The captivity of Judah. 3. The return of their captivity. The harveſt was ſet when <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kah,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Remaliah</hi> ſlew in Judah an hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand men in one day, becauſe they had forſaken the Lord God of their fathers; what a harveſt was here ſet? and the text ſaith, <hi>They were all valiant men for the war.</hi>

                     <hi>Idolatry is a horrible ſin, and God makes it as horrible for judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But what was it that provoked the Lord thus againſt them? becauſe they had forſaken the Lord, the God of their fathers. Gods judgmemts in Scripture cutting down a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, are compared to a harveſt, <hi>Joel,</hi> 3.13 <hi>Put ye in the ſickle, for the harveſt is ripe.</hi> But where was this captivity? in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.8. <hi>And the children of Iſrael carried away captive of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, two hundred thouſand men, ſons and daughters.</hi> But when was their return? in the 9. verſe, the Prophet comes to them, and tells them in the 11. verſe, they muſt deliver up their cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives which they had taken from their brethren; theſe were brethren as is cleer, yet behold the rage of brethren! yet in the 15. verſe, ſee how this took with them; they cloathed, fed, and reſtored all their captives again preſently. See the mighty power of the Word to ſtill the rage of the ſtouteſt ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. Oh that it might do ſo with us at this time, as it did here with this people, this would be a kindly work indeed; ſo that by this you may ſee what the harveſt is here in the text.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Some others reade it thus:<note place="margin">A 3d.</note> When God was about to turn away their captivity, Judah did ſo harden Iſarel in their way, that it was the cauſe of my hardening my heart againſt them, and not to return their captivity.

I have heard of a man who being troubled in conſcience for committing that great ſin of uncleanneſs, the Devil tempting him to commit it again, and told him if he would he ſhould never be troubled more for it, the poor man yeilding to do it, and venturing upon it again, after he had done it he was never tempted again nor troubled more, but preſently lay in a wanzeing, languiſhing ſenceleſs condition and ſo died. Oh take heed of this you that are convinced in your conſciences of the evil of ſuch and ſuch courſes, for it is the great policy of the Devil to make thee who art convinced in conſcience, to ſin againſt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and then he thinks the work is loſt, the Devil doth not much fear the Words working upon him, whom he hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over to live in ſecret known ſins and to venture upon the commiſſion of ſins againſt conſcience; you who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Gods hand of cure, be ſilent, and ſubmit quietly under Gods hand and be not froward, as many are in their troubles of conſcience, but hearken for a word from God;<note place="margin">Troubled Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> as the men of <hi>Benhadad</hi> did from that King, in 1 <hi>King.</hi> 20.33. hearkened diligently whether any words of comfort fel from him, and they catched at them haſtily.

This concerns all people, but eſpecially thoſe that are in trouble of conſcience, thoſe that God begins to ſtir and work upon, take heed I ſay; doth Chriſt himſelf begin to work upon you? doth he deſire to heal you? is he willing to offer his blood to cure you by applying it to your wounded conſciences? Let not the corruptions of your hearts now break forth, now take heed of ſins againſt conſcience, leſt he let you to periſh in your luſts, be willing to let God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone to do his work in you, lie quiet and ſtill, take heed of murmuring and repining ſpeeches, but follow on the work
<pb n="646" facs="tcp:117708:285"/> begun and beſeech him not to leave you till the work be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated in you, and the great hazard of your miſcarrying o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, little do you imagine the wait and burden of thoſe ſins will be upon conſcience which now you commit againſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; what a torment will it be to thy conſcience to think, that at ſuch a time I felt Jeſus Chriſt coming to heal my ſoul in the Miniſtry of his Word, Oh happy had it been for me, if I had lain under his hand, and to have kept his ſalve upon my ſore! but becauſe it was for the preſent troubleſom, and ſmart, I caſt it off and went into ſuch company, and liſtened unto ſuch temptations, and by this means have wounded my ſoul anew moſt deſperately, and now what can I expect but that the Lord ſhould for ever forſake me, and leave me to die in my ſins, and wallow in my blood, and his eye not pity me, &amp; make me to inherit the curſe of that people, whoſe ears ſhould be deaf that they ſhould not hear, whoſe eyes ſhould be blind that they ſhould not ſee and be converted, and I ſhould heal them.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Cyril.</note> ads that, thoſe which went to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade the people, uſed this fetch and device upon the people, and told them it would be for their eaſe and profit not to go up to Jeruſalem, but to petition the King that he out of his Princely love and wiſdom would permit them to worſhip at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel.</hi> And here lay the top of the plot, that the Kings deſign ſo much deſired by him and his Princes, yet this muſt be brought about by the people, they muſt petition to the King that he would grant this liberty to them to worſhip at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> and that they might not go up to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Alphonſus Arragoniae Rex.</note> when it was firſt of all the Kings and the Princes own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. By this you may ſee how wicked and wiſe Idolaters are for the accompliſhment of their purpoſes, by this means Princes obtain their ends, and their plots kept in.</p>
                  <p>Behold the cunning plots of the Devil to delude poor ſouls in matters of worſhip, therefore we had need to look to our waies when we have to deal with cunning Princes and ſubtil pated men.</p>
                  <p>This means was of late uſed among our ſelves, our bakers have been a doing their feats, but they had heated their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven too hot, and ſo their cake proved over baked, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

Thoſe in <hi>Jeroboams</hi> time were wiſe enough to carry on their deſigns with moderation, policy, and ſecrecy, and ſo got the day, though our enemies were not.</p>
                  <p>And as wicked men do ſtay and are contented to wait, till the fitteſt time is for the accompliſhment of their wicked plots, ſo the Devil is contented to wait,<note place="margin">Satans temptat.</note> he firſt tempts the ſoul to ſin, and when the temptation hath prevailed he ſtaies a while and lets the ſin work a while, therefore take heed of letting a temptation prevail, do not roul them up and down in your thoughts, ſaying: what if I ſhould do ſuch a thing, what if I ſhould not; now know, that the Devil is a leavening your hearts, and when your hearts are thus leavened, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil will come in with ſuch ſtrength of temptation that you ſhall not be able to reſiſt him; therefore as Chriſt bad his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to beware of the leaven of the Scribes and Phariſees, ſo take heed of the leaven of Satan in this kind, and in this the Devil deals as God doth with a ſinner in the Goſpel, the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is compared to leaven in <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.33. God he leavens the heart with ſome truth or other, and there lets it lie and ſoak a while in the ſoul, God caſts into the ſoul ſome truth and doth not preſently urge it with violence upon the ſoul, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them preſently upon difficult duties, which they are not capable to perform at the firſt, but lets theſe truths lie, ſoak, and ſpread in the heart, till ſuch time as the diſpoſition and ſavor of the heart be moulded and changed into the truth, and then the Lord comes in with other truths, and works them upon the heart, which it was neither fit nor capable of before; and it were wiſdom in the Miniſters of the Goſpel, to take this courſe, not violently to urge ſtrict and hard duties upon new converts which they are not capable of, as to ſay this muſt be done, and the other muſt not be neglected, but preſs the Goſpel to them and there let it lie and ſoak a while upon the ſpirit, and bleſſed is that ſoul which is thus levened: The Lord wil carry on this work to perfection, theſe begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings the Lord in his time will finiſh.</p>

And therefore when we are in ſtraights, it is good to think thus, Where am I? what am I a doing? am I in my way or no? have I not followed my own counſel and left Gods?

And by this we ſee the great difference there is in praying; Heart-prayer pleaſeth God. A work-man which wants words to expreſs himſelf, yet may be able to perform his buſineſs very wel in Gods account; ſo he that is able to expreſs himſelf in fine language, eloquent ſentences, and multitudes of words, may yet not pray at all: therefore when you pray look that your hearts go along with the duty, otherwiſe, your cries wil be but as their prayers here in the text, which are called <hi>howlings,</hi> and that in theſe four reſpects.<note place="margin">Prayers howlings why.</note>

Even thus it is with many in trouble of conſcience, they are very boiſterous and make troubleſom noiſes, the ſhalloweſt waters makes the greateſt noiſe, but the deepeſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers run the ſtilleſt; ſo thoſe that have the deepeſt ſence of ſin, and are kindly troubled for it, are quiet, ſtill and ſubmiſſive under Gods hand, and certainly ſuch a boiſterousneſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit under the ſence of ſin, is not from the Spirit, although there may be ſome legal terrors, but when God hath ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the heart to himſelf, the heart will ſeek earneſtly for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and yet in a quiet humble way.</p>
                  <p>They howled upon their beds in regard of their pain. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The bruit beaſts in their pain and trouble will cry out and roar: even thus did theſe men here, the extremity of the miſery they were in forced howling from them. There are no men cry more out of judgments when they are executed, than thoſe that were leaſt ſenſible of them when they were threatned. Carnal hearts cry out altogether of the miſerie of the times, the judgment it is that troubles them, more than the ſin the procurer of them. See this between <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and <hi>David, Saul</hi> and <hi>David: Saul</hi> cries, he cries to <hi>Samuel,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I have ſinned, and done fooliſhly, yet honor me I pray thee, before the people. David</hi> he confeſſeth his ſin and accepts of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his iniquity, <hi>Lord, 'tis I that have ſinned, as for theſe ſheep, what have they done? Pharaoh</hi> he cries to <hi>Moſes</hi> that he would pray to God to deliver him from the plagues that were upon him. <hi>David</hi> he cries to God, <hi>Lord take away the iniquity of thy ſervant.</hi> If iniquity be done away, judgment will ſoon be removed, ſin being the cauſe of all miſery.</p>

<pb n="690" facs="tcp:117708:307"/> he contemns and ſcorns them, their prayers, and their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; therefore that in <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.26. is verified here, <hi>He will laugh at their deſtruction, and mock when their fear cometh.</hi> Oh how vile are wicked men in God eyes, when they are in trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and miſery.

God gives his ear to their prayers and attends to the voice of their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication; what doth all this hold forth unto us but this? that the prayers of Saints are very delightful to him, they are pleaſant muſick in his ears, were there no other difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the godly and the wicked than in their prayers, it were ſufficient to make men out of love with the waies of ſin, and joyn with the Saints in the waies of holineſs, the Saints they ſend up ſweet breathings, and God takes pleaſure in them:

But ſaith God, that is not yet done amongſt them which I would have done, it is true, they honor me indeed, but it is as the Nations round about them honor their Gods, they do not honor me as the Infinite Eternal Firſt being of all things; I am not worſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by them as the Infinite, High, Eternal God; people ſhould ſo labor to reform themſelves that they may hold forth the honor of God as he is Infinite, Glorious, Eternal,<note place="margin">How we ſhould honor God</note> and having all power in his hands. The Notes of Obſervation from the words are theſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That God is the moſt high God, the ſupream Majeſtie of Heaven <label type="milestone">

                  <p>
                     <hi>A true repenting ſinner ſhould have the ſight of this high God al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies <label type="milestone">

                  <p>This would make the ſoul to be very ſerious with God, not <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> daring to dally with him who is infinitely above it.</p>
                  <p>It would make the ſoul abhor it ſelf in duſt and aſhes, <hi>Job,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 42.5. there is nothing humbles the ſoul more than this ſight of Gods Majeſtie.</p>
                  <p>It ſhews unto the ſoul the infinite evil which there is in ſin <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> in that I ſhould do nothing but caſt dirt in the face of God.</p>
                  <p>That there is no ſtanding out againſt this high God, that <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> I muſt crouch before him, for he will have the better of me.</p>
                  <p>That he is infinitely worthy of all that I am or have, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> all that I can do, and this very thing would anſwer all temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations againſt God.</p>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> This fight of God would inform us that it is not every ſorrow and ſlight mourning for ſin which will ſerve the turn, but it muſt be ſuch a ſorrow as is becoming ſuch a God.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> In this ſight of God I behold that which hath power in it to raiſe my ſoul above all things here below, ſelf, the world, and all creature comforts, all things muſt be looked upon as under our feet, elſe we cannot cloſe with God.</p>
                  <p> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> I ſee by this ſight, enough in God to make me bleſſed, and that I may bleſs my ſelf in him, in the loſs of all the world; and that there is enough in him to make me amends for all the troubles I have met withal for him. Theſe are the thoughts of a true penitent heart concerning God. Now the ſoul can ſay, the Lord is God, and there is no ſuch God as the Lord, and by this you may put your repentance to the tryal,<note place="margin">Trial of repentanc</note> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be of the right kind or no, by your thoughts of God.

The want of this, theſe people were charged for here: and this hath been our caſe many times, the Lord help our reformers to carry on the work of reformation begun, as before the high God. If we loſe this opportunity, we loſe ſuch an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as yet was ſcarce ever granted to any Nation upon the face of the earth. Now wicked proud men may lift themſeves high in the world, and be thought to be ſomebody for it, but it is the low, broken, penitent ſoul which it the high man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he returns to the high God. But ſecondly, <hi>They return, but it is not to the yoke,</hi> as ſome render the words, They will not come under obedience to Gods commands, for there is but a little difference (namely in the pricks) between <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

So many people, upon exhortation and intreaties will promiſe fair, they will return, and they will do much, but when it
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:117708:310"/> comes to ſee the yooke, Oh they flinch back and hold off, Oh it is too hard for them. It follows.</p>
                  <q>They are like a deceitful bow.</q>
                  <p>Thus did their progenitors they trode in the ſame ſteps, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 78.57. <hi>They kept not his teſtimony,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful bow.</note> 
                     <hi>but turned back and dealt deceitfully as did their fathers, that were turned aſide like a deceitful bow.</hi> Now a bow is deceitful two waies.</p>

How vile and wicked are thoſe men, into whoſe hands God hath committed power to execute juſtice and judgment againſt evil doers, and they ſhall turn all their power againſt the Saints and thoſe that do well.</p>
                  <p>A bow is deceitful when it carries the arrow the wrong <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> way though the Archer ſee the mark, and aim at it, yet it carries quite contrary. Juſt thus did theſe people, many of them had good aims and intentions, and purpoſes, but yet they carried the matter quite contrary; theſe words refer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Jehu's</hi> time, he was a notorious deceitful bow; <hi>Come, ſee my zeal for the Lord,</hi> yet an hypocrit. Oh let us look to our hearts, there may be ſecret warpings in our hearts which may cauſe us to miſcarry for ever, if we take not heed; many who have good intentions, good purpoſes, aims and deſires, and yet have ſome ſecret warping which they know not of,<note place="margin">ſimile</note> which may make them miſcarry to all eternity. A man may with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful bow aim at a beaſt, and yet kill a man; ſo many may think they ſtrike at ſin, and yet with that very goad may at the ſame time wound the Saints. It follows.</p>

                  <p>Theſe were they who had the chief hand in the ſetting up of falſe worſhip, and in oppreſſing thoſe that would not joyn with them: now God would reach theſe great ones. In times of battel Princes ſtand by ſecured at a diſtance, they have their Life guards, they put on others and think to be ſafe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they will bring others into ſtraights, and miſeries and care not though thouſands of them be ſlain at a fight, they

                  <p>When they come to Egypt they think to find them their friends, that they will help them and ſtick unto them; no ſaith God, inſtead of helping them, they ſhall ſcorn them.

Therefore juſt is it with God, that thoſe which forſake him and his help, and go to men for ſuccor, that they by them ſhould be made a ſcorn: O it is a moſt grievous judgment for Gods people to be made a ſcorn by ſuch, the Egyptians! And it ſhould be our care and duty not to put our brethren into ſuch ſtraights, that the poor Saints of God ſhould be forced to go to the wicked for help leaſt, they ſhould reproach them, ſaying, Why do you come to us? What, cannot your holy brethren releeve you? do you expect help from us? But in ſpecial this is their deriſion in the land of Egypt, the rage of their tongue, their fallings out one with another, they could not agree but wrangled and jangled among themſelves, when the Egyptians ſhall ſee this, they ſhall deride them, and look upon them as the greateſt objects of ſcorn that poſſibly can be.</p>
